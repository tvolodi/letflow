# Redeploy letflow to the QA environment on ubuntu-16gb-nbg1-1 (qa.bizdala.com).
# Run as the QA deploy account (or root), on the host:
#   bash /opt/apps/letflow-qa/deploy/redeploy-qa.sh
#
# Relationship to deploy/redeploy-test.sh: this is a SIBLING script, not a
# replacement. redeploy-test.sh targets a different host/path/Compose
# project (/opt/apps/letflow-test on hetzner-prod, Compose project
# letflow-test) and is untouched by REQ-367 -- it still exists to serve its
# own (currently unwired) target. This script targets the real QA
# deployment: /opt/apps/letflow-qa on ubuntu-16gb-nbg1-1, Compose project
# letflow-qa, serving qa.bizdala.com. The two are independent -- deploying
# QA never touches letflow-test and vice versa.
#
# Unlike redeploy-test.sh (backend-only), a QA redeploy has TWO artefacts:
# the backend Docker image and a separately-built frontend static bundle
# (no Node installed on the host -- built in a throwaway node:22 container
# and atomically swapped into place). See steps 4-5 below.
#
# Invoked two ways, mirroring redeploy-test.sh's own precedent
# (ai-dala-infra's T-0111):
#   1. Manually, per ai-dala-infra's deploy-app workflow.
#   2. Automatically, by .github/workflows/cd.yml over a restricted SSH
#      deploy key after CI passes on a push to main. The command=
#      restriction on that key invokes this exact script -- nothing else.
