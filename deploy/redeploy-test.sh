# Redeploy letflow to the test environment on hetzner-prod.
# Run as root (or the CD deploy account) on the host:
#   bash /opt/apps/letflow-test/deploy/redeploy-test.sh
#
# Invoked two ways, mirroring the sibling letflow-queue repo's precedent
# (ai-dala-infra's T-0108):
#   1. Manually, per ai-dala-infra's deploy-app workflow.
#   2. Automatically, by .github/workflows/cd.yml over a restricted SSH
#      deploy key after CI passes on a push to master. The command=
#      restriction on that key invokes this exact script — nothing else.
