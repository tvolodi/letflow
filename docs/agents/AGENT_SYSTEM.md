# Letflow — Agent System Overview

**Audience:** every agent operating within this project. Read this before beginning any
task, alongside `docs/agents/instructions/core-directives.md`.

---

## 1. Purpose

This is the root reference for Letflow's multi-agent development pipeline. It replaces
the earlier 4-agent roster (`ORCH`/`ELIXIR-DEV`/`TEST-RUNNER`/`REVIEWER`) with the full
roster below, per `docs/migration/decisions/0004-humanless-pipeline.md` — every
producing role is paired with a validating role, the pipeline runs commit-to-merge
without a human gate, and every role file is written explicitly enough for a
weak/inexpensive model to execute reliably.

## 2. Core principle

**The system is the documentation.** Agents don't hold state in memory between
sessions — state lives in `docs/requirements.yaml`, `docs/status/`, `handoffs/`, and
the codebase itself.

**Every producing step has a validating step.** See `core-directives.md`'s
producer/validator table — restated here as the roster's organizing shape.

## 3. Agent roster

| Agent ID | Role | Responsibility | May write to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ORCH` | Orchestrator | Routes work, classifies requests, delegates, escalates. Does no implementation work itself. | `handoffs/`, `docs/status/`, `docs/requirements.yaml` (status field only) |
| `REQ-ANALYST` | Requirement Analyst | Drafts and structures requirements into `docs/requirements.yaml` | `docs/requirements.yaml`, `handoffs/` |
| `REQ-VALIDATOR` | Requirement Validator | Validates requirements for completeness, testability, consistency with existing requirements and decision records | `handoffs/` |
| `CODE-DESIGNER` | Code Designer | Produces module interfaces, `@spec`s, gen_statem/Ecto shape, and data-flow notes before any implementation code is written | `lib/letflow/design/`, `handoffs/` |
| `CODE-DESIGN-VALIDATOR` | Code Design Validator | Reviews CODE-DESIGNER's artefact — every acceptance criterion covered, no implementation code present, design is unambiguous enough for ELIXIR-DEV/FRONTEND-DEV to proceed. **Hard gate.** | `handoffs/` |
| `ELIXIR-DEV` | Elixir Developer | Implements `lib/letflow/` and `priv/repo/migrations/` per the design artefact | `lib/`, `priv/repo/migrations/`, `config/*.exs`, `handoffs/` |
| `FRONTEND-DEV` | Frontend Developer | Builds and changes `web/`, Letflow's own React/TS SPA, and wires it to Letflow's API. Full ownership as of 2026-08-21 — see `docs/migration/decisions/0011-frontend-ownership.md`; the earlier "config/integration only, not a rewrite" mandate is superseded | `web/`, `docs/frontend/`, `handoffs/` |
| `MOBILE-DEV` | Mobile Developer | **Dormant.** Builds `apps/mobile/` (Flutter/Dart) per `docs/mobile/`. Activated when S9's three backend gaps close (REQ-124..126) — nothing routes here before then, and `apps/mobile/` does not exist yet | `apps/mobile/`, `docs/mobile/`, `handoffs/` |
| `REVIEWER` | Idiom & Scope Reviewer | Checks changes for idiomatic OTP usage (crutch vs. real behaviour), supervision integrity, scope creep, and consistency with `docs/migration/decisions/` records | `handoffs/`, `docs/migration/stage-N-*.md` (REVIEWER sign-off sections only) |
| `SECURITY-REVIEWER` | Security Reviewer | Gates any change touching a tenant-data path against `docs/agents/instructions/security-invariants.md`. **Hard gate for in-scope changes.** | `handoffs/` |
| `TEST-DESIGNER` | Test Designer | Produces test specs and test code (ExUnit, StreamData properties) | `test/specs/`, `test/`, `handoffs/` |
| `TEST-DESIGN-VALIDATOR` | Test Design Validator | Reviews TEST-DESIGNER's output — every MUST acceptance criterion has a runnable test, no skipped/deferred coverage, fixtures are isolated. **Hard gate.** | `handoffs/` |
| `TEST-RUNNER` | Test Runner | Executes `mix test`, diagnoses failures, produces a structured test report | `test/reports/`, `handoffs/` |
| `ISSUE-FIXER` | Issue Fixer | Root-cause diagnosis for a queued issue (WF-03 Step 0.5/1). Does not implement the fix itself — routes to ELIXIR-DEV/FRONTEND-DEV once CODE-DESIGNER has a fix design | `docs/issues/`, `handoffs/` |
| `RELEASE-VALIDATOR` | Release Validator | Validates a stage/requirement-batch meets all MUST acceptance criteria before it's marked RELEASED; re-runs the full suite rather than trusting TEST-RUNNER's report alone | `handoffs/`, `docs/status/` |
| `DOC-UPDATER` | Documentation Updater | Updates `docs/requirements.yaml` status, `docs/status/requirement_status*.yaml` (the index and all volumes), `README.md` where it documents current behavior, and any stage/decision doc a requirement's acceptance criteria named | `docs/`, `README.md`, `handoffs/` |
| `UAT-RUNNER` | UAT Runner | Executes scenario-based acceptance checks against a running Letflow instance once one exists to test against; role defined now, scenario corpus deferred to S7 (`docs/migration/stage-7-simulation-uat-parity.md`) | `test/uat-reports/`, `handoffs/` |
| `BA-<VERTICAL>` | Business Analyst (per tenant-vertical/solution-pack) | Authors UAT scenarios in tenant-vertical domain language and signs off on UAT-RUNNER's execution results for its scope, per `.claude/agents/ba-analyst.md` — one canonical role file, parameterized by vertical via `docs/agents/ba-personas/<vertical>.yaml`, not a closed per-company roster | `test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/<vertical>/`, `test/uat-reports/` (`ba-signoff-` prefix), `docs/agents/ba-personas/` (new-persona/reuse bookkeeping), `handoffs/` |
| `PRODUCT-OWNER` | Product Owner (platform-level business authority) | Reads every BA-<VERTICAL> sign-off for a UAT run, cross-checks MUST-severity acceptance-criteria coverage against `docs/requirements.yaml`, enforces the single-BLOCKER-blocks-release rule, arbitrates cross-vertical disagreements (routing to REQ-ANALYST if the underlying requirement is ambiguous), and writes the platform's plain-language release recommendation. Answers "should we ship?" — distinct from RELEASE-VALIDATOR's "is it safe to ship?" (`.claude/agents/product-owner.md`) | `test/uat-reports/` (`po-signoff-` prefix), `handoffs/` |

**Deliberately not reproduced from R-Co, historically — now fully actioned:**
R-Co's `BO-SWIFTROUTE`/`BO-VORTEX`/`BO-MERIDIAN` business-owner-persona layer was
actioned by REQ-359 as the `BA-<VERTICAL>` row above; R-Co's `PRODUCT-OWNER` role
is actioned by REQ-361 as the `PRODUCT-OWNER` row above. See
`docs/migration/decisions/0004-humanless-pipeline.md`'s original "What is
explicitly NOT reproduced" section and its 2026-09-16 and 2026-09-17 addenda for
the full history of this deferral and its closure.

**`handoffs` in the Writes column means the agent's own handoff file only** (updated
2026-08-17, ISS-0021/GH#78 — this table previously left `handoffs/registry.json`
ownership unresolved, contradicting `docs/agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md`'s explicit "ORCH
MUST... maintain `handoffs/registry.json`"). `handoffs/registry.json` itself is
ORCH-exclusive: ORCH updates it on every other agent's behalf when it processes that
agent's completed handoff, per `docs/agents/shared/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` §4. No role
other than `ORCH` writes to `registry.json` directly, regardless of what this table's
`Writes` column otherwise says for that row.

---

## 4. Handoff system

Agents communicate through handoff files under `handoffs/<RUN-ID>/`. Full schema,
timestamp rules, and completion mechanics: `docs/agents/shared/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`.

ORCH may act directly, without spawning a subagent or writing a handoff file, only when
a change passes all six checks of `docs/agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md` §10's sizing rule — that
section is the canonical definition and this file does not restate the test. The
handoff-file machinery exists for multi-step work where independent validation actually
matters; forcing it onto a one-line typo fix would be ceremony without benefit.

---

## 5. Requirement status tracking

`docs/requirements.yaml`'s `status:` field is authoritative for a requirement's current
state (`pending | in_progress | done | blocked`) — this file's schema is **not**
replaced by the fuller pipeline, only routed through it. `docs/status/requirement_status.yaml`
remains the append-only event history (`started`/`done`/`blocked`/`cancelled`/`revised`/`verified`), kept in bounded volumes behind
`docs/status/requirement_status.index.yaml`.

The pipeline overlays a finer-grained status internal to a single WF-02 run (tracked in
that run's handoff files, not in `docs/requirements.yaml` itself):

```
pending → validated → designed → design-reviewed → implemented →
test-designed → test-design-reviewed → tested → released
```

Only `pending`, `in_progress`, `done`, `blocked` are ever written to
`docs/requirements.yaml` — the finer states above live in the run's own handoffs, so a
requirement's file-level status stays exactly as terse as it's always been.

**Output format rule:** YAML for everything except handoff files (JSON — machine-read
by ORCH as structured data). See `core-directives.md`.

---

## 7. Conflict prevention

An agent MUST check the registry (`handoffs/registry.json`) for a handoff already
`IN_PROGRESS` against the same artifact before starting. ORCH is responsible for
sequencing concurrent work to avoid collisions — see `docs/agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md`'s
`owned_modules` lock, same mechanism as R-Co's.

---

## 8. Agent identity contract

When an agent is invoked, it operates under a stated `AGENT_ID` from the roster above.
Default, if none is stated: `ORCH` — same default as the earlier 4-agent system, see
`CLAUDE.md`.

## 9. Canonical instruction surfaces

| Content | Canonical location |
|---|---|
| Per-`AGENT_ID` role instructions | `.claude/agents/*.md` |
| Cross-cutting rules binding every role | `docs/agents/instructions/core-directives.md` |
| Security invariants | `docs/agents/instructions/security-invariants.md` |
| Handoff lifecycle mechanics | `docs/agents/shared/HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` |

| Multi-host task selection/locking (`letflow-queue`) | `docs/agents/protocols/TASK_QUEUE.md` |
| Standard workflow step chains | `docs/agents/workflows/WF-*.md` |
| Roster, handoff schema, capability matrix, artifact locations | this document |
| Orchestration decision logic, stage gates | `docs/agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md` |

`CLAUDE.md` stays a pointer file — it names the roster and links here, it does not
restate role instructions.
