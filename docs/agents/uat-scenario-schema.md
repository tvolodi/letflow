# UAT scenario schema

Canonical documented home for the shape of a UAT scenario file under
`test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/**/*.yaml`. Mechanically enforced (the mechanical
half only — see below) by `mix letflow.check_uat_scenario_schema`
(`lib/mix/tasks/letflow.check_uat_scenario_schema.ex`), wired into
`mix letflow.check`.

This document covers the two REQ-358 additions — `scope:` and the
`branches:`/`when:` step-level branching construct — plus the pre-existing
required top-level fields the mix task also checks. It does not re-derive the
full pre-existing per-step/per-expected-outcome shape field by field; see
`.claude/agents/uat-runner.md`'s "Reading the scenario corpus" section and the
worked examples in `test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/` for that.

## Pre-existing required top-level fields (unchanged)

`id`, `title`, `version` must each be present and a non-empty string. These
predate REQ-358; the mix task validates them alongside the new fields because
it validates the whole current shape, not only the additive surface.

## `scope:`

New **optional** top-level key on a scenario file:

```yaml
scope: platform            # or an open tenant-vertical/solution-pack identifier string
```

- Type: non-empty string. Not a closed enum. `"platform"` is the one reserved
  literal value with special meaning (see the classification rule below);
  every other value is an open tenant-vertical/solution-pack identifier
  chosen freely by whoever authors the scenario (e.g. `"lending"`,
  `"logistics"`, or — for a scenario ported from/tied to one of the three
  legacy R-Co companies — the literal company name, which today already
  functions as a de facto vertical identifier for those 11 files).

**Classification rule** (adapted verbatim in substance from R-Co's
`uat-scenario-schema-v1.1-addendum.md`): *if a business user of a tenant
installation would notice the behaviour being tested, the scenario keeps its
tenant-vertical `scope`; use `scope: platform` only when the actor is the
platform operator (`role: PLATFORM_ADMIN` or equivalent) or the platform
itself (a system actor acting outside any tenant's data, e.g. definition
promotion, cross-tenant isolation checks).*

This rule is **not mechanically checkable** — it requires judging what a
scenario's action actually represents. `mix letflow.check_uat_scenario_schema`
enforces only the mechanical half: is a `scope` value *resolvable* at all
(presence/non-emptiness/string-type — rule `SCHEMA-3`), never whether the
value chosen is the *correct* classification.

### `scope:` / `company_id:` relationship

`scope` and `company_id` coexist as two distinct axes, not one superseding
the other, with a default that derives `scope` from `company_id` when `scope`
is absent:

- `company_id:` stays what it already is: for tenant scenarios, the
  identifier of one of the (currently 3, legacy, R-Co-ported) literal
  companies whose actor ids and process definitions the scenario data is
  concretely bound to; for platform scenarios, the literal string
  `"platform"`.
- `scope:` is the new, broader, open classification: is this scenario's
  behaviour tenant-visible (and if so, which tenant-vertical/solution-pack)
  or platform-operator-visible. It exists because a real Letflow tenant is
  created dynamically and belongs to whatever solution pack it installed —
  a scenario authored against Letflow's own runtime (not a ported R-Co
  fixture) will often have no natural `company_id` at all, only a `scope`
  value naming the vertical/pack it's validating (e.g. `scope: lending` with
  no `company_id:` key).
- **Default (backward compatibility):** when `scope:` is absent from a
  scenario file, it is read as:
  1. `"platform"` if `company_id: platform` is present, else
  2. the literal value of `company_id:` if `company_id:` is present (each of
     the 3 legacy company names is treated, today, as its own one-member
     "tenant-vertical" — an accepted historical exception), else
  3. absent entirely — a scenario with neither `scope:` nor `company_id:` is
     not auto-classified; `SCHEMA-3` flags this as an error, because a
     scenario with no scope information at all is exactly the
     "invisible to classification" case the addendum rule exists to prevent.
- No existing file needs editing for this schema to apply: all 11 tenant
  files carry `company_id: <name>`, all 18 platform files carry
  `company_id: platform`; the default rule above classifies every one of the
  29 unchanged.
- New scenarios should write `scope:` explicitly rather than relying on the
  `company_id:` default, since `scope` is the field classification questions
  are actually asked of; `company_id:` becomes optional going forward for
  scenarios with no natural literal-company binding.

### Worked example — explicit `scope`, no `company_id`

```yaml
id: lending-fast-track-approval
scope: lending
title: Fast-track approval for a pre-qualified lending applicant
version: "1.0"
# ...
```

### Worked example — default derivation (today's 29 files, unchanged)

```yaml
id: meridian-loan-origination-below-threshold
company_id: meridian
# no scope: key -- resolves to scope: "meridian" via the default rule
title: Small loan (€50k) approved at L2 without committee
version: "1.0"
# ...
```

## Step-level branching (`branches:` / `when:`)

New **optional** key at step-group level: a named list of **branches**, each
gated by a `when:` condition, replacing (for scenarios that need it) a single
flat `steps:`/`expected_outcomes:` list with a `branches:` list of named
sub-paths. Backward compatible: a scenario with no `branches:` key behaves
exactly as before REQ-358 (flat `steps:`/`expected_outcomes:`, unconditional).

A file carries **either** top-level `steps:`+`expected_outcomes:` **or**
`branches:`, never both, never neither (rule `SCHEMA-4`).

### Shape

```yaml
branches:
  - name: platform_admin_dashboard          # string, unique within the file
    when:
      fact: role
      op: eq
      value: PLATFORM_ADMIN
    steps:
      - step: 1
        actor: viewer
        action: >
          Signs in as a platform administrator and lands on the post-login screen
        via: gui
    expected_outcomes:
      - id: EO-001
        description: Platform admin dashboard is shown
        verification:
          method: page_state
          detail: "URL/route is the platform-admin dashboard; page shows tenant list"
        on_fail:
          severity: BLOCKER
          business_impact: Platform admins cannot reach their operating console.
          suggested_action: route_to_wf03

  - name: tenant_user_dashboard
    when:
      fact: role
      op: in
      value: [TENANT_ADMIN, TENANT_USER]      # eq/in are the only allowed operators
    steps:
      - step: 1
        actor: viewer
        action: Signs in as a tenant user and lands on the post-login screen
        via: gui
    expected_outcomes:
      - id: EO-001
        description: Tenant workspace dashboard is shown
        verification:
          method: page_state
          detail: "URL/route is the tenant dashboard; page shows this tenant's data only"
        on_fail:
          severity: BLOCKER
          business_impact: Tenant users cannot reach their workspace after login.
          suggested_action: route_to_wf03

  - name: unauthenticated_fallback
    when: else                                 # reserved literal: matches iff every
    steps:                                      # preceding branch's `when` did not match
      - step: 1
        actor: viewer
        action: Attempts to reach the post-login screen without signing in
        via: gui
    expected_outcomes:
      - id: EO-001
        description: The login form is shown instead of any dashboard
        verification:
          method: page_state
          detail: "URL/route is the login form; no dashboard content is present"
        on_fail:
          severity: BLOCKER
          business_impact: Unauthenticated visitors can reach a dashboard.
          suggested_action: route_to_wf03
```

The complete worked example above (all three branches together, exercising
`eq`, `in`, and `else`) is committed as a throwaway validation fixture at
`test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/_throwaway/login-routing-example.yaml` — see that
file's header comment for its scope and lifecycle.

### Key/shape rules

- `branches:` is a **list**, evaluated top-to-bottom. Each entry: `name`
  (string, unique within the file — used only in the UAT report, e.g.
  `EO-001 (branch: platform_admin_dashboard)`), `when` (a condition — see
  below, or the literal string `else`), `steps:` (same shape as today's
  top-level `steps:`), `expected_outcomes:` (same shape as today's top-level
  `expected_outcomes:`), and optionally `preconditions:` (same shape as
  today's top-level `preconditions:`, scoped to this branch only — omit to
  reuse the file's top-level `preconditions:` unchanged; a branch's own
  `preconditions:`, if present, *replaces* the top-level list rather than
  merging with it).
- `when:` condition shape (deliberately narrow — **not** a general expression
  language):
  ```yaml
  when:
    fact: <string>     # a runtime-observable fact name, e.g. "role"
    op: eq | in         # the ONLY two allowed operators
    value: <string>     # for op: eq
    # or
    value: [<string>, ...]   # for op: in
  ```
  Allowed operators: **`eq`** (fact value equals `value` exactly,
  case-sensitive string comparison) and **`in`** (fact value is a member of
  the `value` list, same comparison rule). No boolean composition
  (`and`/`or`/`not`), no numeric/relational operators, no nested conditions.
  This is the entire allowed vocabulary — anything requiring more is an
  explicit signal to escalate to `REVIEWER` before extending the construct,
  not to quietly grow it.
  - `when: else` (the bare literal string, not a mapping) is reserved and
    means "matches iff no earlier branch in this file's `branches:` list
    matched." At most one `else` branch is allowed per file, and if present
    it must be the **last** entry (`SCHEMA-6` enforces both mechanically).
- **Facts** are named, runtime-observable values UAT-RUNNER is expected to
  already have or be able to obtain mid-run. Exactly one fact has a
  procedurally-defined evaluation method today: **`role`** — the
  authenticated session's role, or the literal string `"unauthenticated"`
  when no session is authenticated (i.e. `when: {fact: role, op: eq, value:
  unauthenticated}` is an equivalent, more explicit spelling of what `when:
  else` is shorthand for in the specific case of "not signed in" — both are
  legal). See `.claude/agents/uat-runner.md`'s "Evaluating a `when:` branch"
  section for the runtime evaluation procedure. Any other `fact:` name is
  legal syntactically (this schema does not enumerate a closed fact
  vocabulary) but only `role` has a defined evaluation method — a scenario
  using an undefined fact name must say, in its own `description`, how a
  human/agent reading it would obtain that fact's value; the mechanical check
  cannot and does not check this (semantic, not mechanical).

## Actor roster (`test/fixtures/uat/actors.yaml`) — REQ-452

Scenario files do not state what built-in role an actor holds (29 of the 32 are
`Ported verbatim` and must stay byte-identical), so roles live in one separate
roster file, outside `scenarios/**`. Keys, all strings:

```yaml
actors:                                  # required, non-empty; key = login actor id
  actor-platform-admin:
    tenant: platform                     # tenant slug, or the literal "platform"
    builtin_roles: [PLATFORM_ADMIN]      # non-empty; names from Authorization.roles/0
    routing_roles: []                    # optional; process-routing role names
    note: "free text"                    # optional
unresolved:                              # optional; actors whose role could not be established
  actor-swiftroute-tobias:
    searched:                            # required, non-empty: the searches performed
      - "scripts/seed_swiftroute_persona_actors.sh: tobias absent"
platform_actor_allowed:                  # optional; scenario `id` -> non-empty reason
  swiftroute-tenant-onboarding-happy: "tenant onboarding is performed by the platform operator"
refusal_coverage_exempt: [bilimbaga]     # optional; scopes exempt from rule (e); may only shrink
legacy_platform_admin:                   # optional; tenant actors seeded as PLATFORM_ADMIN
  actor-acme-bob:
    since: "2026-10-06"                  # ISO date
    reason: "no TENANT_ADMIN until REQ-447"
    removed_by: REQ-454
```

A *login actor* is any id in a scenario's top-level `actors:` values or a step `actor:`
that starts with `actor-`, excluding `actor-system-*` and `actor-any`. `unresolved`
is a recorded gap (never guess a role); an actor there is exempt from rules (b)-(d).

Correct: the example above (every key valid). Rejected (`SCHEMA-12`, roster path as file):

```yaml
actors: {}
```
```
[SCHEMA-12] test/fixtures/uat/actors.yaml: `actors:` is missing, not a mapping, or empty
```

A missing, unreadable or unparseable roster is one `SCHEMA-12` violation and the
cross-file rules (a)-(e) are then skipped. The task prints
`Actor roster: <path> -- <n> login actor(s) in corpus: <i> in roster, <u> unresolved, <m> missing`.

## Refusal step (`expect_refusal`) — REQ-452

Optional boolean step key, in flat `steps:` and in `branches[].steps`:

```yaml
- step: 4
  actor: viewer
  action: The viewer tries to delete the approved order
  expect_refusal: true
```

`true` means the named actor attempts the described action and the scenario passes
**only if the product refuses it**; the `action:` prose stays business language. Absent
means `false`. UAT-RUNNER treats an unrefused attempt as a failed step. Only the literal
`true` counts toward rule (e). A non-boolean value is rejected:

```yaml
  expect_refusal: "yes"
```
```
[SCHEMA-12] test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/acme/order.yaml: step 4: expect_refusal must be a boolean
```

## Actor and refusal rules (a)-(e) — REQ-452

Violations print as `[<RULE>] <file>: <message>`. Rule (b) reads
`Letflow.Api.Authorization.roles/0` at check time, so new roles need no edit here.

**(a) `SCHEMA-7` — every login actor is in the roster or `unresolved`.**
Correct: scenario `actors: {buyer: actor-acme-bob}` with `actor-acme-bob` under roster `actors:`.
Rejected (no entry anywhere):
```
[SCHEMA-7] test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/acme/order.yaml: login actor "actor-acme-bob" has no entry in test/fixtures/uat/actors.yaml under actors: or unresolved:
```

**(b) `SCHEMA-8` — every `builtin_roles` value is a known role.**
Correct: `builtin_roles: [TASK_WORKER]`. Rejected: `builtin_roles: [TENANT_BOSS]`:
```
[SCHEMA-8] test/fixtures/uat/actors.yaml: actor "actor-acme-bob" lists builtin_roles value "TENANT_BOSS" which is not in Authorization.roles/0 (PLATFORM_ADMIN, PROCESS_DESIGNER, ...)
```

**(c) `SCHEMA-9` — a non-platform actor must not hold `PLATFORM_ADMIN`.**
Correct: `tenant: acme`, `builtin_roles: [TASK_WORKER]` (or listed under `legacy_platform_admin`).
Rejected: `tenant: acme`, `builtin_roles: [PLATFORM_ADMIN]`, no legacy entry:
```
[SCHEMA-9] test/fixtures/uat/actors.yaml: actor "actor-acme-bob" has tenant "acme" (not platform) but holds PLATFORM_ADMIN and is not listed under legacy_platform_admin
```

**(d) `SCHEMA-10` — a platform actor only in scope `platform`, or an allowed scenario.**
Correct: `actor-platform-admin` in a `scope: platform` scenario, or in scenario id
`swiftroute-tenant-onboarding-happy` listed under `platform_actor_allowed` with a reason.
Rejected: the same actor in a `scope: acme` scenario `acme-order` not listed:
```
[SCHEMA-10] test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/acme/order.yaml: platform actor "actor-platform-admin" appears in scenario "acme-order" whose resolved scope is "acme"; allowed only in scope platform or when the scenario id is listed in platform_actor_allowed with a non-empty reason
```

**(e) `SCHEMA-11` — every scope has a refusal step, or is exempt.**
Correct: at least one scenario of scope `acme` has a step with `expect_refusal: true`, or
`refusal_coverage_exempt: [acme]`. Rejected: scope `acme` with 1 scenario, no refusal step,
not exempt (reported on the first scenario path of the scope, sorted):
```
[SCHEMA-11] test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/acme/order.yaml: resolved scope "acme" has 1 scenario(s) and none has a step with expect_refusal: true; add one or list "acme" under refusal_coverage_exempt
```
`refusal_coverage_exempt` may only shrink: a test asserts it is a subset of the list
frozen in the test file.

## Mechanical rules enforced by `mix letflow.check_uat_scenario_schema`

Each a distinct `rule` tag in that task's output — see the module's own
`@moduledoc` for the authoritative list (`SCHEMA-0` through `SCHEMA-12`; 7-11 are the
roster/refusal rules above, 12 the roster-shape and `expect_refusal` type check). In
summary: the corpus is non-empty; each file parses as YAML; `id`/`title`/
`version` are present; a resolved `scope` exists; a file uses exactly one of
`steps:`+`expected_outcomes:` / `branches:`; each branch has a valid `name`/
`when`/`steps:`/`expected_outcomes:` shape; and at most one `when: else`
branch exists, last in the list. The task never checks the *semantic*
correctness of a `scope` classification or a `fact` choice — see the
classification-rule note above.

## How the preflight reads a scenario

(An actor's built-in role is not read from the scenario or guessed from the username: the
source is `test/fixtures/uat/actors.yaml`. The preflight script itself is unchanged.)

`scripts/uat_preflight.sh` (WF-05 Step 0) builds its PRECONDITIONS manifest from:
`company_id`/`scope` (tenant + Keycloak realm; `platform` = the default realm),
`process_id` (deployed definition), `actors:` (login actors; `actor-system-*` and
`actor-any` are not logins; `actor-<tenant>-<name>` is matched against a seeded username
first by exact name (`actor-<tenant>-<name>` itself, the `ai-dala-infra` realm-qualified
convention) and, failing that, by the older `<name>-*` prefix heuristic; `actor-platform-admin`
to the PLATFORM_ADMIN user), and `pipeline_test:` (must exist, must not carry an unresolved
`NOTE (ISS-05xx)` forward-reference, must not invoke `docker compose`/`docker exec`/`psql`
in its own executable code — a mention of those words in a comment does not count, and
neither does a comment alone stop the check from also flagging a spec that calls
`db-exec.ts`'s `runSqlAgainstDevPostgres(...)` helper, which really does shell into
`docker compose` at runtime even though the spec file's own text never says so; see
ISS-0909(b)). The mapping is best-effort; unmappable actors report UNKNOWN. A `proc-*`
process_id is additionally checked against `GET /definitions/active/:name` — see ISS-0894.
When a `test/fixtures/uat/process-definition-aliases/<process_id>.yaml` sidecar exists, its
`definition_name` is resolved instead of the raw `process_id` — see ISS-0893.

**Realm resolution and caching (ISS-0909a).** The realm(s) tried for a login actor are
derived from the actor id itself (`actor-<tenant>-<name>` → `<tenant>` tried first),
then the current scenario's own declared tenant if different, then `bpm-default` as the
final fallback — never inherited from whichever OTHER scenario/tenant happened to
reference the same actor name first. A login attempt is cached per `(actor_id, realm)`
pair, never per bare actor/user name, so a `BAD_CRED` result in one realm can never
poison a later check of the same actor id in a different realm.

**`app_roles` probe per actor (ISS-0909c).** `actor-platform-admin` is probed against
`GET /api/v1/admin/services` (`:AdminServicesRead` → `:UsersGroupsRolesManage`, held only
by `PLATFORM_ADMIN` — `lib/letflow/routers/admin_services.ex`), not `/tasks/inbox`, since
a platform admin may hold no TASK-oriented role at all regardless of their real role
grant. A candidate-labeled actor is probed against `GET /api/v1/me/modules` (granted to
every role); every other actor is probed against `GET /api/v1/tasks/inbox`.

## `--credential-source` protocol (two recognized variants, ISS-0909d)

`scripts/uat_preflight.sh --credential-source PATH --credential-protocol {qa-login|qa-uat-env}`
(`--credential-protocol` defaults to `qa-login`, the original/pre-existing shape):

- **`qa-login`** (`ai-dala-infra/scripts/qa-login.sh`): invoking `PATH` with no
  arguments lists every seeded username, one per line, each 2-space-indented
  (`^\s{2}([a-z0-9][\w-]*)\s` — trailing text on the line, e.g. a role annotation, is
  ignored). Invoking `PATH <username>` prints a line `Password: <pw>`; preflight
  performs the OIDC Resource Owner Password Credentials grant itself against the
  actor's resolved realm(s).
- **`qa-uat-env`** (`ai-dala-infra/scripts/qa-uat-env.sh`): this protocol has no stable
  no-argument username listing (its accounts are realm-qualified and provisioned
  per-tenant, ISS-0894/T-0150), so preflight instead takes the seeded-username roster
  directly from the scenario corpus's own login actor ids — valid because this
  protocol's accounts are named *exactly* `actor-<tenant>-<name>`, the scenario actor id
  itself. Invoking `PATH token <actor_id>` prints a line `Token: <bearer-token>` — an
  already-issued access token, not a password — which preflight verifies with a single
  read-only `GET /api/v1/me/modules` call instead of performing its own OIDC grant.

Both variants report through the same `actors`/`app_roles`/`definitions` checks and the
same `(actor_id, realm)` cache described above; only credential *acquisition* differs.
