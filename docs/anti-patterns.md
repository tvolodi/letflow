# Anti-patterns — Letflow

Known mistakes and their correct alternative, logged as they're found.
Read this before doing anything non-trivial (see `CLAUDE.md`). Empty
sections are expected early on — this grows with the project.

Format per entry: what happened, why it's wrong for this project
specifically, the correct alternative.

<!-- Example shape, remove once the first real entry lands:

## Reporting `mix test` as passing without running it

An agent said "the property test should now cover the new transition"
without actually running `mix test`. This violates the No Speculation
rule in `CLAUDE.md` and defeats the point of the property test, which
exists specifically to catch cases a human wouldn't think to assert by
hand (README §4).

**Correct alternative:** run `mix test`, quote the actual output. If
the environment can't run it (no toolchain, no network for
`mix deps.get`), say that explicitly instead.

## No Elixir/mix toolchain on PATH in this sandbox

Agents repeatedly discover (correctly, per the No Speculation rule)
that there's no local Elixir/mix toolchain, and stop at "can't verify."
There's a working alternative: Docker is available. Run a throwaway
`elixir:1.17-otp-27` container plus an isolated `postgres:16` container
on a private Docker network (`docker network create`, then both
containers `--network` onto it, referencing Postgres by container name
as the DB hostname rather than `localhost`). This sidesteps host port
5462 too, which may already be held by another local Postgres
container — don't touch a container that isn't yours.
Mount the repo read-write into the Elixir container
(`-v //c/...:/app -w /app`), run `mix local.hex --force` /
`mix local.rebar --force` once, then `mix deps.get` / `mix compile` /
`mix ecto.create` / `mix ecto.migrate` / `mix test` as `docker exec`
calls. Tear down both containers and the network afterward. On
Windows/Git Bash, bare `/app`-style paths get mangled by MSYS path
conversion — prefix affected `docker run`/`docker exec` calls with
`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`. If `config/test.exs` hardcodes `localhost:5462`,
temporarily change it to read `System.get_env("LETFLOW_DB_HOST",
"localhost")` / a port env var with the same fallback, run the
verification, then revert the config file back to its committed
contents afterward — don't leave the env-var indirection in a tracked
file for a one-off verification run.

**Correct alternative:** try Docker-based verification before reporting
"can't run it" as final — it worked cleanly for REQ-001 (12/12 tests,
including a StreamData property test, against a real Postgres).

## Overwriting `docs/status/requirement_status.yaml` instead of appending

An agent (ELIXIR-DEV, REQ-003) found the file didn't match its
expectations and rewrote it from scratch with a different header
format and field names (`requirement`/`timestamp_utc` instead of the
established `req`/`at`), silently discarding every prior history entry
(REQ-001, REQ-002). The file's own header comment says "Append one
entry per event. Never rewrite past entries" — this is exactly the
mistake that comment exists to prevent. ORCH caught it by diffing
against what it had just written and restored the lost entries.

**Correct alternative:** always read the existing file in full before
touching it, preserve its established schema even if a different shape
seems cleaner, and append (don't replace). If the file is genuinely
missing, use the header/entry shape already documented in this repo's
other status files or CLAUDE.md, not an invented one.
