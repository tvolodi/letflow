# Letflow role charter

Decision record: `docs/migration/decisions/0046-admin-scopes-and-role-charter.md` (cite as "0046 D<n>").
This is the TARGET state after REQ-446..448. Eight built-in roles, in the order of
`Letflow.Api.Authorization.roles/0` (the six existing roles, then TENANT_ADMIN, TENANT_AUDITOR).
The set is closed: a module cannot create a role (0046 D10).

Two scopes. Platform scope = the organisation operating Letflow. Tenant scope = one customer
organisation, inside its own tenant only. The platform tenant is the one tenant named by server
configuration; if that is missing, no tenant is the platform tenant (0046 D1, D2).

## PLATFORM_ADMIN
- Scope: platform. Honoured only in the platform tenant; not seeded or issuable anywhere else.
- Who holds it: the staff of the organisation operating Letflow.
- Does: everything, including create, change and deactivate tenants, platform migrations, event retention.
- Must not: act inside a customer tenant or read a customer's business data.

## PROCESS_DESIGNER
- Scope: tenant.
- Who holds it: people who model processes and entities for their organisation.
- Does: create and change definitions and entity definitions, start instances, manage custom roles.
- Must not: cancel instances, complete tasks, manage users or tokens, read the audit log.

## PROCESS_OPERATOR
- Scope: tenant.
- Who holds it: people who run live processes day to day.
- Does: start, cancel and watch instances, assign and complete tasks, handle the dead-letter queue, webhooks, audit and metrics.
- Must not: change definitions, manage users, tokens or roles.

## TASK_WORKER
- Scope: tenant.
- Who holds it: ordinary staff who do assigned tasks.
- Does: read and complete their tasks, read definitions, query entity data they may see.
- Must not: start or cancel instances, assign tasks, change anything else.

## AGENT_RUNNER
- Scope: tenant.
- Who holds it: machine accounts for the (deferred) runtime-agent subsystem; no human.
- Does: read help and its memberships.
- Must not: touch processes, tasks or data.

## CANDIDATE
- Scope: tenant.
- Who holds it: external people sitting an exam.
- Does: list the tenant's installed modules; exam-session actions come from the exam module's own grants.
- Must not: hold any core permission beyond that, so it cannot query entities.

## TENANT_ADMIN
- Scope: tenant. The owner role of one customer organisation.
- Who holds it: the customer's administrators (existing tenant admins are migrated here, 0046 D8).
- Does: every tenant-scope permission in its own tenant: users, groups, role bindings, API tokens, settings, modules and solutions, audit log.
- Must not: hold any platform-scope permission, or bypass the deactivated-tenant gate.

## TENANT_AUDITOR
- Scope: tenant, read-only.
- Who holds it: compliance officers, auditors, managers.
- Does: read definitions, instances, all tasks, audit, metrics, attachments, entity data, and promotions reads once the ownership proof exists.
- Must not: write, export, import, manage tokens, users, roles, modules or settings.

## Matrix

Format, parsed by the REQ-448 parity test: one row per permission; first column the permission atom
without the colon; then one column per role in `roles/0` order (eight columns); cells `yes` or `no`;
final column `scope` (`platform` or `tenant`); whitespace-separated, first line is the header.
PLATFORM_ADMIN `yes` means as evaluated in the platform tenant. Rows after `EntitiesRestrictionsManage`
are planned permissions (REQ-446 names, `TenantSettingsManage` split); a permission REQ-446 classifies
as platform (promotion platform-events) is added by REQ-446 as `platform`, PLATFORM_ADMIN only.
Module (Catalog) permissions are all tenant scope and are not listed.
Conditional cells: the TENANT_ADMIN and TENANT_AUDITOR `yes` cells for PromotionsRead and PromotionsManage
hold only if REQ-446 proves or adds the source-tenant ownership check (0046 D3, binding condition);
otherwise only PLATFORM_ADMIN holds them, or they become platform scope.
