defmodule Letflow.Api.Authorization do
  @moduledoc """
  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  Role/permission authorization matrix and 403 decision contract — ports
  `src/api/authorization.zig` (281 lines, R-Co). Pure module: no `Plug.Conn`,
  no I/O, never raises on any input. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req069-authorization.md` for the full design.

  ## Untrusted input: roles are caller-influenced strings, not R-Co's enum

  `Letflow.Plugs.AuthPipeline` populates `conn.assigns[:auth_context][:roles]`
  from `Letflow.Oidc.ClaimMapping.resolve_roles/2`, whose contract is
  `[String.t()]` — an arbitrary list of strings taken from the bearer token's
  own claims. `roles_from_strings/1` converts that untrusted list into the
  closed `role/0` atom set: an unrecognized string is silently dropped (never
  raises, never widens to any role), and an all-unrecognized or empty input
  list both correctly yield `[]`, which `evaluate_access/2` treats identically
  to "the caller holds no role at all." `String.to_existing_atom/1` is
  deliberately NOT used for this conversion — it would let attacker-controlled
  token content reach the atom table, an unbounded-atom-creation vector.

  ## SECURITY (INV-2, INV-5)

  * **INV-2** — every decision `evaluate_access/2` returns is a pure function
    of its two arguments (`AccessContext.t()`, `endpoint_policy_key()`). There
    is no third parameter through which request-derived data (a query string,
    a body field, an `assignee_id` filter) could reach this function, so
    `AllowWithRowFilter`'s row scope can only ever be the `AccessContext`'s own
    `user_id` — never anything a caller supplies elsewhere in the same
    request. This is structural, not merely tested.
  * **INV-5** — this module answers only "is this action allowed," never
    "does this resource exist." A cross-tenant resource lookup must be
    resolved to 404 by REQ-072's request-context/scoping layer BEFORE
    `evaluate_access/2` is ever called with that resource in scope — routing a
    cross-tenant lookup through this module and returning its `Deny403` to the
    caller would let a prober distinguish "exists, not yours" from "never
    existed," which is exactly what INV-5 forbids. Wrong role, right tenant is
    correctly `Deny403`; any resource outside the caller's own tenant is
    REQ-072's 404, never this module's `Deny403`.

  ## Ported-but-currently-unreachable entries

  `AGENT_RUNNER` (role) and `DlqOperate`/`WebhooksManage` (permissions) have no
  S4 route consumer today — runtime agent orchestration, the DLQ, and webhook
  dispatch are all deferred subsystems. Ported anyway so the matrix matches
  R-Co's exactly, and so a later reader doesn't have to rediscover the gap.

  ## `AttachmentsManage`/`AttachmentsRead` (REQ-212) — genuinely new, not pre-ported

  Unlike `DlqOperate`/`WebhooksManage` above (ported ahead of their consuming
  routes, matching R-Co's matrix exactly even before any route consumed them),
  `AttachmentsManage` and `AttachmentsRead` have **no R-Co counterpart at
  all** — `instance_attachments` (REQ-211) is new functionality this
  migration invents, not a ported R-Co subsystem. Added *for*
  `Letflow.Routers.Instances`'s four `/instances/:id/attachments...` routes,
  immediately consumed, never in a "ported but currently unreachable" state.
  Two permissions, not one collapsed permission, is also a deliberate split
  (unlike `DlqOperate`/`WebhooksManage`'s single-permission precedent):
  `AttachmentsManage` gates upload/delete (mutation), `AttachmentsRead` gates
  list/download (read) — REQ-212's own acceptance criteria require the split
  kept, not collapsed. See design
  `lib/letflow/design/req212-instance-attachments-routes.md` §6.

  ## `Entities*` (REQ-309) — added ahead of their consuming router

  `:EntitiesDefinitionsRead`, `:EntitiesDefinitionsWrite`,
  `:EntitiesRecordsWrite` and `:EntitiesQuery` (plus their identically-named
  `endpoint_policy_key/0` values and the ten `endpoint_policy_key/2` clauses for
  `/entities/...`) are added by REQ-309 **before** `Letflow.Routers.Entities`
  exists — REQ-310 creates that router and mounts it. This is a compile-time
  precondition, not an oversight: `Letflow.Api.AuthorizedRouter`'s `authz_*`
  macros take the policy key as a literal and
  `test/letflow/api/authorization_enforcement_test.exs` asserts every declared
  route resolves to a real, non-`:Unknown` key, so a router declaring
  `:EntitiesDefinitionsRead` before that clause exists would fail immediately.
  Same "added ahead of its consuming route" state `:DlqOperate`/
  `:WebhooksManage` above already sat in. There is deliberately **no**
  `:EntitiesRecordsRead` atom — `Letflow.Entities.Records` exposes no read
  function and record reads happen only through `POST /entities/query`, so an
  `:EntitiesRecordsRead` would be dead vocabulary. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req308-entity-http-surface.md` §1 and §3.

  ## `EntitiesRecordsExport`/`EntitiesRecordsExportUnredacted`/`EntitiesRecordsImport` (REQ-318) — added ahead of their consuming routes

  Three more atoms, minted ahead of REQ-319/REQ-320's routes, the same
  "ported/added ahead of its consuming route" state `:DlqOperate`/
  `:WebhooksManage` and REQ-309's four `Entities*` atoms above already sat in
  — see `lib/letflow/design/req314-entity-record-bulk-export-import.md` §5.

  * `:EntitiesRecordsExport` — route-level, gates
    `POST /entities/records/:entity_type/export` (REQ-319). Real
    `endpoint_policy_key/2` clause.
  * `:EntitiesRecordsExportUnredacted` — **deliberately NOT route-level**.
    No `(method, path)` pair resolves to it via `endpoint_policy_key/2` — no
    route exists whose method+path maps to it, since it is checked a SECOND
    time, in-handler, only when an export request body carries
    `unredacted: true` (design §6 INV-2's two-tier mechanism). It still has a
    `required_permission/1` identity clause and a place in `permission()`/
    `endpoint_policy_key()`/`@permissions`, because REQ-319's handler calls
    `evaluate_access/2` against it directly, positionally, exactly as this
    module's own INV-2 moduledoc section above already establishes nothing
    requires the atom passed to `evaluate_access/2` to be one
    `endpoint_policy_key/2` itself resolves.
  * `:EntitiesRecordsImport` — route-level, gates
    `POST /entities/records/:entity_type/import` (REQ-320). Real
    `endpoint_policy_key/2` clause. Deliberately a genuinely separate grant
    from `:EntitiesRecordsWrite` — not a policy-key-only divergence mapped
    back onto it the way `:DefinitionsImport` maps back onto
    `:DefinitionsWrite` above (design §5 states why bulk record import is
    materially riskier than a single `create_record/2` call).

  Per design §5, this requirement deliberately adds **no** new
  `role_allows?/2` clause for `PROCESS_DESIGNER`, `PROCESS_OPERATOR`, or
  `TASK_WORKER` against any of the three — only `PLATFORM_ADMIN`'s existing
  catch-all grants them today. A future REVIEWER-led role-matrix pass decides
  wider role assignment once REQ-319/REQ-320 ship; `:EntitiesRecordsExportUnredacted`
  in particular is flagged (design §5) as reserved for a break-glass/
  platform-administrative role, never bundled into an ordinary tenant role's
  default grant set.

  ## `EntitiesAttachmentsManage`/`EntitiesAttachmentsRead` (REQ-317) — genuinely new, not pre-ported

  Added *for* `Letflow.Routers.Entities`'s four
  `/entities/records/:entity_type/:record_id/attachments...` routes, per
  design `lib/letflow/design/req313-entity-record-attachments.md` §3/§4. Two
  NEW atoms, not a reuse of `:AttachmentsManage`/`:AttachmentsRead` (those
  gate `Letflow.Repository.Attachments`' instance_id-scoped table only) nor
  of `:EntitiesRecordsWrite` (that gates the record's own `field_values`
  payload, a different capability). Create/delete (mutation) map to
  `:EntitiesAttachmentsManage`; list/get-content (read) map to
  `:EntitiesAttachmentsRead`, matching REQ-212's own manage/read split. See
  design §7 (OQ-2) for the role matrix.

  ## `ExamSession*` (REQ-335) — genuinely new, not pre-ported, and CANDIDATE-reachable

  Five new atoms for `Letflow.Modules.Exam.Router`'s five routes
  (`:ExamSessionStart`, `:ExamSessionRead`, `:ExamSessionSave`,
  `:ExamSessionSubmit`, `:ExamSessionReportEvent`), each with a real
  `endpoint_policy_key/2` clause and an identity `required_permission/1`
  clause, the same shape as `Entities*` above.

  `CANDIDATE` (added by ISS-0646, see decision 0013's addendum) is a new,
  dedicated role holding exactly these five permissions and nothing else;
  `TASK_WORKER` no longer holds them. A candidate sitting an exam is an
  ordinary authenticated tenant user reaching their OWN session (every
  delegate call is additionally ownership-checked inside
  `Letflow.Modules.Exam.Session`/`Letflow.Modules.Exam.AntiCheat` themselves, ownership never
  being a function of role). `:PROCESS_DESIGNER`/`:PROCESS_OPERATOR`
  continue to not hold them, for the same reason as before — sitting an exam
  is not part of either role's existing grant shape; `PLATFORM_ADMIN`'s
  catch-all still covers an operator who also needs to probe a session.

  ## `PublicReadHandlesIssue` (REQ-352) — genuinely new, not pre-ported

  One new atom for `Letflow.Routers.PublicReadHandles`'s single
  `POST /public-read-handles` route (design
  `lib/letflow/design/req352-unauthenticated-read-platform.md` §13.1). Names
  the generic registry table (`public_read_handles`) and the one write
  operation it exposes (`issue`) — no vertical named, per that design's own
  vocabulary rule (§14/§15). Minted here, in the same diff as the route
  consuming it, since decision 0028's standing prohibition already places
  the writer this permission gates on this requirement's side of the
  read/write split. **Deliberately no `role_allows?/2` clause added for it
  against any non-`PLATFORM_ADMIN` role** — only `PLATFORM_ADMIN`'s existing
  catch-all grants it today; which role(s) beyond that hold it is left to
  the requirement that authors the first concrete issue path consuming this
  permission (REQ-355, per the design's §13.1).

  ## `HelpRead` (REQ-366 §1) — genuinely new, CANDIDATE deliberately excluded

  One new atom for `Letflow.Routers.Help`'s single `GET /help/resolved`
  route (design `lib/letflow/design/req366-help-display-panel.md` §1.3).
  Real `endpoint_policy_key/2` clause and identity `required_permission/1`
  clause, same shape as `Entities*`/`ExamSession*` above.

  Design §1.3 states this permission is "granted to all six roles...
  unconditionally on any recognized role" and flags that as its own **OQ-2**,
  explicitly inviting REVIEWER to judge a narrower grant instead. This
  module implements a **deliberate, flagged deviation** from that literal
  instruction: `role_allows?/2` grants `:HelpRead` to `PLATFORM_ADMIN`,
  `PROCESS_DESIGNER`, `PROCESS_OPERATOR`, `TASK_WORKER`, and `AGENT_RUNNER`,
  but **not** `CANDIDATE`. Reason: `test/letflow/api/authorization_test.exs`'s
  ISS-0646 closed-set invariant test ("CANDIDATE must hold exactly its six
  ExamSession*/ExamCertificateIssue permissions and nothing else",
  decision 0013's addendum) already settled that `CANDIDATE`'s permission
  set is closed — silently widening it here would be exactly the "don't
  silently re-decide what a decision record already settled" case this
  project's core directives forbid. Flagged for SECURITY-REVIEWER/REVIEWER
  (this run's own next two gates) to make the actual call between keeping
  `CANDIDATE` excluded (this implementation) and widening ISS-0646's closed
  set for `:HelpRead` specifically (design §1.3's literal instruction). See
  `Letflow.Routers.Help`'s own moduledoc for the same note.

  ## `MembershipsRead` (REQ-384 Part A) — genuinely new, CANDIDATE excluded for the same reason as `HelpRead`

  One new atom for `Letflow.Routers.Identity`'s `GET /me/memberships` route
  (design `lib/letflow/design/req384-tenant-switcher-cache-isolation.md`
  §2.2). Real `endpoint_policy_key/2` clause and identity
  `required_permission/1` clause, same shape as `HelpRead`/`Entities*` above.

  Design §2.2 states this is "any authenticated user, no extra role gate —
  a user reading their own membership list is not a privileged operation."
  This module implements that as widely as `HelpRead`'s own precedent
  allows: `role_allows?/2` grants `:MembershipsRead` to `PLATFORM_ADMIN`,
  `PROCESS_DESIGNER`, `PROCESS_OPERATOR`, `TASK_WORKER`, and `AGENT_RUNNER`,
  but **not** `CANDIDATE` — for the identical reason `HelpRead` excludes it
  (see that section above): `test/letflow/api/authorization_test.exs`'s
  ISS-0646 closed-set invariant ("CANDIDATE must hold exactly its six
  ExamSession*/ExamCertificateIssue permissions and nothing else") already
  settled `CANDIDATE`'s permission set as closed, so widening it here would
  silently re-decide that closed-set invariant rather than route it through
  REVIEWER/SECURITY-REVIEWER, which is exactly the deviation `HelpRead`
  already flags and defers to those two gates. A candidate account
  switching tenants was not named by any of REQ-384's acceptance criteria
  either. Flagged the same way as `HelpRead`'s section above, not silently
  narrowed.

  ## `:ModulesManage` (REQ-401) — same non-pattern as `:TenantsManage`

  One new core permission, added by REQ-401 to implement
  `docs/migration/decisions/0039-platform-module-solution-layering.md` D5.
  It gates module install (REQ-403, now wired — see `endpoint_policy_key/2`'s
  `"POST", "/tenant/modules"` clause and `required_permission/1`'s
  `:ModulesManage` identity clause below), solution install (REQ-415), and
  module-settings writes (REQ-414) — the latter two do not exist yet.
  Granted only via `PLATFORM_ADMIN`'s existing unconditional `true` clause —
  there is no explicit `role_allows?(some_role, :ModulesManage)` clause
  anywhere, exactly the way `:TenantsManage` is granted (its own total
  absence from every other role's clause, not a positive grant to imitate).

  ## `:MyModulesRead` (REQ-403) — role-agnostic, granted to every role including CANDIDATE

  One new core permission for `Letflow.Routers.Me`'s `GET /me/modules`
  route (design `lib/letflow/design/req403-module-install-route.md` §5.2,
  decided by ORCH 2026-09-24). Unlike `:MembershipsRead`/`:HelpRead` above,
  this permission is deliberately granted to **every** role, including
  `CANDIDATE` — it grows CANDIDATE's ISS-0646 closed permission set by
  exactly this one atom rather than leaving CANDIDATE excluded the way
  `:MembershipsRead` does. The grant is a single new **public**
  `role_allows?/2` clause — wildcard first argument, literal
  `:MyModulesRead` second argument, unconditional `true` body (see the real
  clause itself, below, for the exact text; not reproduced verbatim here so
  this doc paragraph itself does not count as a second grep hit for AC6's
  contract) — placed as the very first `def role_allows?/2` clause in this
  module —
  above the existing generic `role, permission` clause — so it short-
  circuits before `core_role_allows?/2`'s five per-role `defp` clauses (and
  before the Catalog `role_grants/1` fallback) are ever consulted for this
  one permission. No per-role list in `core_role_allows?/2` gains
  `:MyModulesRead` — this is intentional, not an oversight (AC6's grep
  contract checks exactly this).

  ## Catalog-sourced permissions and role grants (REQ-401, D4)

  `permissions/0` and `role_allows?/2` are both widened by REQ-401 to also
  recognize permissions declared by `Letflow.Modules.Catalog`'s registered
  modules (REQ-400) — atoms typed `atom()` at that boundary, never members
  of this module's own closed `permission()` union. `core_permissions/0`
  keeps returning the closed, core-only list `permissions/0` itself used to
  return before this requirement. See `core_permissions/0`, `permissions/0`,
  and the public `role_allows?/2` (which delegates to the renamed private
  `core_role_allows?/2`) below for the mechanics.

  for any permission the core matrix itself denies. `or` short-circuits on a

      existing catch-all therefore also covers module permissions;

      `permission in Letflow.Modules.Catalog.role_grants(role)` — this can
      only ever flip a pair from `false` to `true` for a permission atom a
      registered module actually grants that role, never for a core
      permission (`Letflow.Modules.Catalog.validate/1`'s
      `{:core_permission_collision, _}` rule keeps the two atom sets
      disjoint, checked against `core_permissions/0`).

  A Catalog-granted permission is typed `atom()` at the Catalog boundary
