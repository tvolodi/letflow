    # other child, so nothing below this line can log an unredacted

    # REQ-219 (design req219-supervision-layering.md §2): the flat 20-child
    # list this module used to build directly is now layered into three
    # sibling supervisors -- Letflow.Supervisor.Infrastructure,
    # Letflow.Supervisor.Pollers, Letflow.Supervisor.Http -- each owning a
    # disjoint slice of the original 20 children (see each module's own
    # moduledoc for its exact children list and ordering guarantees).
    # Infrastructure MUST be listed before Pollers: Supervisor starts
    # children strictly in list order, one child's start_link/1 completing
    # before the next begins, so listing Infrastructure first is what makes
    # ISS-0429's "Obs.Alerts.TaskSupervisor registered before either
    # Poller's first tick" guarantee structural (a supervisor-boundary
    # guarantee, not merely a list-position fact) -- see
    # Letflow.Supervisor.Infrastructure's own moduledoc. :one_for_one here
    # (not :rest_for_one) is deliberate: every named-process infra child is
    # looked up BY NAME at its call sites, never by stored pid, so a rare
    # Infrastructure exit has no pid-based dependency reason to also
    # force-restart Pollers or Http; a Pollers crash-loop exhausting its own
    # restart intensity (Letflow.Supervisor.Pollers' own moduledoc) now
    # kills and restarts ONLY that one layer.
    #
    # ISS-0451 (design iss0451-poller-crash-budget-isolation.md §3.4a/§4):
    # Pollers' own child spec is `restart: :temporary` -- the top-level
    # Letflow.Supervisor structurally NEVER auto-restarts
    # Letflow.Supervisor.Pollers, for any exit, ever. This closes a
    # PERSISTENT (never-clearing) Poller fault's path to exhausting THIS
    # supervisor's own restart budget: without it, Pollers re-exhausts its
    # own 5/60 budget in ~24-30ms per cycle (measured), which cascades to
    # exhaust the top level's budget too and takes the whole application
    # down in well under a second. Letflow.Supervisor.PollersBreaker (added
    # below, right after Pollers) becomes the SOLE process that ever
    # restarts Pollers, via Supervisor.start_child/2 -- see that module's
    # own moduledoc for the full state machine. The children-list entry
    # below MUST use the 2-arg Supervisor.child_spec/2 call form (not a
    # bare {module, arg} 2-tuple, which Supervisor.init/2 normalizes as
    # "call module.child_spec(arg)" -- threading arg into start_link, not
    # into child-spec overrides -- and would silently NOT apply
    # `:temporary`; live-verified during this design's own rework, see the
    # design doc §3.4a).

    # ISS-0451: max_restarts raised from the OTP default (3) to 5;
    # max_seconds stays at the OTP default (5). Pollers-attributable
    # restarts now consume exactly ZERO of this budget (restart: :temporary
    # above), so this budget is available entirely to
    # Infrastructure/Http/PollersBreaker (all :permanent). The +2 is pure
    # extra headroom for an unrelated coincidence of transient restarts
    # among those three landing in the same rolling window -- not sized
    # against any Pollers-consumption figure, since there is none. A
    # genuinely crash-looping Infrastructure or Http child still exhausts
    # this only-slightly-larger budget in the same order of magnitude of
    # time the OTP default would have, preserving REQ-219 decision 3's own
    # "a fault severe enough that taking the app down is still correct"
    # property for those children.
