defmodule Letflow.Definitions do
  @moduledoc """
  Context module for definition-related read/compute functions. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req041-pack-update-diff-schema.md` §5.3 for
  `compute_pack_update_plan/5`'s full reasoning.

  **This file did not exist before REQ-041.** The design (§5.3) names
  `Letflow.Definitions` as "the existing context module this batch's
  functions all attach to," citing `req035` §5.1 as having already
  established it as the expected home for `compute_pack_update_plan/5` by
  name — but no `lib/letflow/definitions.ex` context-module file was actually
  present in this codebase prior to this requirement (only schema submodules
  under `lib/letflow/definitions/`, e.g. `ProcessDefinition`,
  `PromotionReview`). REQ-036, whose `compute_promotion_plan/5` would have
  been this module's first function, is still `status: pending`
  (`docs/requirements.yaml`). REQ-041 creates this file; noted here as a
  deviation-from-assumption worth flagging honestly, not a silent one — the
  module name, namespace and this function's placement all match the design
  exactly, only the file's prior existence was assumed incorrectly.

  ## Scope

  `compute_pack_update_plan/5` and `classify_artefact/3` (REQ-041), `create/2`,
  `get_by_id/2`, `get_active_by_name/2`, `list/2`, `activate/2`, `deprecate/2`,
  `archive/2` (REQ-030), and `search/2` (REQ-042) together make up this module's
  current public API. See `lib/letflow/design/req030-definition-store-crud.md` for
  the full design the REQ-030 functions implement, and
  `lib/letflow/design/search.md` for `search/2`'s.

  ## `tenant_id` is always derived, never accepted (REQ-030)

  `create/2`'s `attrs` never accepts a `:tenant_id` (or `"tenant_id"`) key -- a caller
  supplying one gets `{:error, :tenant_id_not_accepted}`, not a silently-overridden value.
  `tenant_id` is always derived from `opts[:prefix]` via
  `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.tenant_id_for_schema_name/1`, mirroring
  `Letflow.EventStore.append/2`'s identical contract (see
  `lib/letflow/design/req025-event-append.md` and
  `docs/migration/decisions/0003-ecto-schema-strategy.md`'s 2026-08-17 addendum).

  ## `activate/2`'s `service_scope_validator` option -- the SVC-03 integration point (REQ-031)

  `activate/2` accepts an optional `:service_scope_validator` key in its `opts`, a 2-arity
  function `(Letflow.Definitions.Graph.t(), tenant_id) -> :ok | {:error, term()}` or `nil`
  (the default). When present, it is called once, only when the target definition's current
  status is `:draft` (never on the already-active no-op path, never on a rejected
  non-draft transition), after the row lock is acquired and before either of the two
  transition UPDATEs run. A `{:error, reason}` return aborts the whole activation with
  `{:error, {:service_scope_violation, reason}}` and writes nothing. **This module builds
  only the injection point** -- the hook's own logic (walking SERVICE_TASK nodes, checking
  tenant/service/plugin scope) is REQ-031's job, not implemented here.

  ## `apply_promotion_assertion_rerun/6`'s gate condition and crash-safety scope (REQ-040)

  The apply pipeline (REQ-037's `mark_review_applied/2` path) gates on this function's
  recorded `assertions_failed == 0` -- NOT on `status == "passed"`. These are not the same
  check: a passing assertion replay whose sandbox teardown itself fails is recorded as
  `status = :teardown_failed` with `assertions_failed` still `0` (the real replay found
  zero failures; only the *teardown* failed, tracked separately via a
  `PROMOTION_ASSERTION_TEARDOWN_FAILED` event, never folded into the assertion counts). A
  `teardown_failed` row is therefore a **green gate** -- a caller that checks
  `status == :passed` instead of `assertions_failed == 0` will read this outcome
  backwards and incorrectly block a promotion that should proceed.

  Crash safety: the claim -> load-fixtures -> replay -> release -> record-outcome span is
  wrapped in a single `try/rescue`. This covers three exit classes -- normal completion,
  a typed error return from any step, and a raised exception anywhere in that span -- and
  on all three, `SandboxPool.release/2` is attempted and the `promotion_assertion_runs`
  row is written with fail-closed accounting (`assertions_failed >= 1`) rather than left
  stuck at `status = :running`. It does **not** cover a hard process kill
  (`Process.exit(pid, :kill)`), a BEAM node crash, or `System.halt/0` -- none of these run
  a `rescue` clause, so a sandbox claimed and a row left `:running` at the moment one of
  those events fires is neither released nor updated by this function. This residual gap
  is a disclosed, deferred limitation, not an oversight: the concrete mitigation (a
  background reaper sweeping stale `:running` rows and orphaned sandbox schemas, mirroring
  R-Co's `reclaimLeakedSandboxes`) is not built here and is left to a dedicated follow-up
  requirement -- the same deferral `Letflow.SandboxPool`'s own moduledoc already carries
  for the analogous owner-crash-detection gap on an already-claimed sandbox.

  ## `search/2` -- full-text search over `name`/`description` (REQ-042)

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  `search/2` (REQ-042) adds definition full-text search over `process_definitions`'
  `name`/`description` columns via `ILIKE` ranking, ported from `store.zig`'s
  `Store.search()` per `src/design/definition.md`'s PD-10 section. **PD-10 states
  explicitly that search lives inside the existing store -- no new Zig source file or SQL
  migration is required**, and this port adds zero new `priv/repo/migrations/` files and
  zero new indexes (no `idx_def_name`, no GIN/`tsvector` index) -- the query runs against
  `process_definitions` exactly as REQ-027 shipped it.

  ## `delta/2` -- `GET /definitions/delta` cursor semantics (REQ-125, MOB-3)

  See `lib/letflow/design/req125-definitions-delta-sync.md` for the full design.
  `since` is a per-tenant-schema **monotonically increasing integer**
  (`process_definitions.sequence_number`), never a wall-clock timestamp.

  Clock skew is exactly the failure mode this endpoint runs under: a mobile
  device warming an offline cache compares its last-seen watermark against the
  server on every subsequent sync, often after being offline for hours or
  days, on hardware whose clock is not NTP-disciplined the way the server's
  is. Had `since` been `updated_at` (a server-clock-stamped column compared
  against a value the *device* last stored), every device clock's drift,
  timezone misconfiguration, or leap-second smear would become a correctness
  bug in what the device believes it already has. A monotonic integer has no
  notion of "now" on either side -- it is a pure watermark, compared with `>`,
  never interpreted as elapsed time. The counter (`definition_sequence`,
  mirroring `Letflow.EventStore`'s `instance_sequence` at tenant-schema
  granularity instead of per-instance granularity) is server-assigned and
  bumped inside the same transaction as the row mutation it sequences, so "the
  cursor advanced" and "a row actually changed" can never disagree.

  A `since` that "predates retained history" is not a distinguishable error
  state here, unlike `Letflow.Api.Pagination`'s minted cursors (which expire
  24h *by design*): `definition_sequence`'s counter has no expiry and no
  pruning, so `since: nil` (or `0`) is the well-defined "give me full history"
  case (every row that exists), not a special-cased reset response. Only
  syntactic validity is checked -- a negative integer or a non-integer string
  is `{:error, :invalid_since}` (400); a `since` numerically larger than the
  tenant's actual high-water mark simply returns an empty delta,
  indistinguishable from "already caught up," which is deliberately the safe
  behaviour (never fabricates a "full resync required" signal from a value
  that could equally mean "already current").

  Computes a solution-pack update three-way diff plan for one tenant's
  install of one pack against an offered incoming version, per
  `lib/letflow/design/req041-pack-update-diff-schema.md` §5.3.

  Read-only — performs no mutation (INV-PU-5). Queries
  `solution_pack_artefact_bases` (the `base` lookup, by `(tenant_id, pack_id,
  artefact_type, artefact_id)`) and `pack_update_resolutions` (the
  `has_unresolved_conflicts` lookup, by `(tenant_id, pack_id, target_version:
  incoming_version, artefact_type, artefact_id)`) but writes neither those nor
  `solution_pack_installs`.

  `theirs_artefacts`/`incoming_artefacts` are caller-supplied — no real
  install/export path exists yet to source them from (SOL-01/02/03, unscoped).
  `base` is never caller-supplied: it is always looked up from
  `solution_pack_artefact_bases` by this function itself, because AC2's core
  assertion (an artefact with no matching base row classifies `:conflict`) is
  a statement about this function's own DB-lookup behavior, not about a value
  a caller chooses to omit.

  The artefact set processed is the union of `theirs_artefacts`' and
  `incoming_artefacts`' `{artefact_type, artefact_id}` keys, in first-seen
  order (theirs first, then incoming) — an artefact named in neither list is
  not represented in the returned plan at all.

  Returns `{:error, :empty_artefact_set}` when both `theirs_artefacts` and
  `incoming_artefacts` are `[]` — an empty result would otherwise be
  ambiguous between "nothing changed" and "caller passed no data by
  mistake" (mirrors REQ-036's `compute_promotion_plan/5`'s empty-plan error;

  `base`/`theirs`/`incoming` are compared by **byte-level string equality**
  over content that MUST already be canonical-JSON text by the time it
  reaches this function (sorted keys, no insignificant whitespace) —
  REQ-041's own description says this comparison uses "same normalization as
  REQ-036's plan digest," but REQ-036's `compute_plan_digest/1` is
  `status: pending` and has no shared canonicalization helper to call yet
  (design §5.4, OQ-1). This function does not parse, re-serialize, or
  normalize anything itself, and does not reimplement REQ-036's
  canonicalization as a private duplicate — that would risk drifting from
  REQ-036's real implementation once it ships.

  `nil` is never treated as equal to any other value, including another
  `nil` compared against a third non-nil value. A `nil` `base` (no matching

  Creates a new DRAFT process definition, per PD-01/PD-02/PD-05/PD-06.

  `tenant_id` is never accepted in `attrs` -- it is always derived from
  `opts[:prefix]` (see this module's moduledoc). `attrs[:graph]` must pass all three
  of `Letflow.Definitions.Graph.validate_graph/1`, `validate_node_attributes/1` and
  `validate_edge_conditions/1` before anything is written (INV-DS-3): on the first
  failing phase, returns `{:error, {:graph_validation_failed, violations}}` and writes
  zero rows.

  Two concurrent calls with an identical `(name, version)` never both succeed: the
  `uq_definition_version` unique index is the targeted `ON CONFLICT` arbiter, and the
  loser gets `{:error, :duplicate_name_version}` -- neither caller is told which one
  "won" (design §4.1 P11/P12).

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  Rolls back `process_key` to `target_version`, per
  `lib/letflow/design/req038-promotion-rollback.md` (ported from R-Co's
  `src/definition/rollback.zig`, PRM-08).

  `tenant_id` is never a separate argument -- derived from `opts[:prefix]`, same as
  every other function in this module (design §2 arity note). `opts[:permission_checker]`
  and `opts[:event_appender]` are both `Keyword.fetch!/2`'d -- no built-in default for
  either, raises `KeyError` if omitted, same no-default stance `Promotion.promote_definition/3`
  already established (design §4).

  `opts[:permission_checker].(actor_id, tenant_id)` is checked before any row is read or
  locked (AC5, INV-RB-1): a `false` result returns `{:error, :forbidden}` immediately, no
  transaction opened.

  The pointer swap runs inside one `Repo.transaction/1` that locks every
  `process_definitions` row for `(tenant_id, process_key)` `FOR UPDATE` (design §5 step
  2a). Three guard cases, checked in this order, each writing zero rows
  (INV-RB-5):

    PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
    * no row currently `:active` for this `process_key` -> `{:error, :process_key_not_found}`
      (covers both "process_key never existed" and "every version already
      deprecated/archived" -- design §5 step 2b, a faithful port of `rollback.zig`'s own
      unification).
    * `target_version` already the active version -> `{:error, :already_active}` (checked
      before the target-row lookup, design §5 step 2c).
    * no row matching `target_version` with status in `[:active, :deprecated]` (R-Co's
      `SUPERSEDED` maps onto Letflow's `:deprecated` -- design §3) -> `{:error, :version_never_active}`.

  On success, the previously-active row moves `:active -> :deprecated` and the target row
  moves to `:active` (both `updated_at`-stamped), matching `activate_draft/2`'s own
  deprecate-then-activate swap shape.

  After the transaction commits, `opts[:event_appender]` is called exactly once
  (INV-RB-6) with a `DEFINITION_VERSION_ROLLED_BACK`-shaped payload
  (`process_key`/`from_version`/`to_version`/`actor_id`) -- deliberately outside the
  transaction, same divergence from R-Co's literal "single serializable transaction"
  framing that `promote_definition/3` already established (design §4.2/§8 OQ-3). A
  `{:error, reason}` here propagates unchanged as this function's own result; the pointer
  swap has already durably committed by this point.

  On a successful event-append, any `promotion_reviews` row for `(tenant_id,
  process_key)` with status `:applied` or `:approved` is looked up and, **only when
  exactly one such row matches**, superseded via `PromotionReviewStore.supersede_review/3`
  (INV-RB-10). Zero matches or more than one ambiguous match both resolve to
  `superseded_review_id: nil`, never a guess among several candidates and never a
  blanket-supersede of every match -- design §6 states in full why a naive `def_id`-only
  lookup cannot disambiguate which review corresponds to the specific former-active
  definition, and why guessing would risk corrupting unrelated audit rows (this was the
  defect CODE-DESIGN-VALIDATOR's Rework 1 blocked on). A per-row `supersede_review/3` race
  (`{:error, :invalid_transition}`) is absorbed the same way (design §6/§7, OQ-6) -- never
  fatal to an otherwise-successful rollback, since the pointer swap and event-append have
  already committed by that point.

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  Ports `src/definition/assertion_rerun.zig`'s `applyPromotionAssertionRerun` (PRM-06/07)
  -- idempotent assertion replay against an ephemeral REQ-039 sandbox, keyed by
  `(review_id, plan_digest)`.

  Returns the cached `{:ok, result}` with `idempotent_hit: true` on a second call for the
  same `(review_id, plan_digest)` pair, claiming no sandbox. On a fresh call: claims a
  sandbox (`Letflow.SandboxPool.claim/2`), loads only `artifact.fixtures[]` into it
  (`Letflow.SandboxPool.FixtureLoader.load_fixtures_only/3` -- never organic tenant data),
  replays each assertion twice under a frozen clock and a seeded, reset-between-runs RNG,
  and records `status` + `assertions_total`/`assertions_passed`/`assertions_failed` +
  `failing_assertion_ids` in `promotion_assertion_runs`.

  **Gate condition -- read before wiring this into the apply pipeline:** callers must gate
  on the returned `assertions_failed == 0`, NOT on `status == :passed`. A
  `status = :teardown_failed` result with `assertions_failed == 0` is a green gate -- see
  this module's moduledoc, "`apply_promotion_assertion_rerun/6`'s gate condition and
  crash-safety scope".

  **Crash safety -- also see this module's moduledoc:** the claim-through-release span is
  wrapped in `try/rescue`, covering normal completion, typed errors, and raised
  exceptions. It does NOT cover a hard process kill or a BEAM crash mid-replay -- that
  residual gap is disclosed, not resolved, and left to a deferred reaper follow-up.

  `tenant_id` is never a separate argument -- derived from `opts[:prefix]`, same as every
  other function in this module. `opts[:event_appender]` is `Keyword.fetch!/2`'d -- no
  built-in default, raises `KeyError` if omitted, same no-default stance
  `rollback_definition_version/4` already established. `opts[:assertion_evaluator]` DOES
  have a built-in default (`default_assertion_evaluator/2`, design §3/§6) -- a deliberate
  divergence, since there is a sensible placeholder to fall back to here, unlike
  `event_appender`, which has no data path to a real implementation without
  caller-supplied plumbing.

  Runs REQ-028/029's three graph validators over one **stored** definition's
  graph and merges their outcomes. Backs
  `POST /api/v1/definitions/:id/validate` (`Letflow.Routers.Definitions`).

  **The composition lives here, not in the route, and that is the point.**
  REQ-078's AC4 requires the endpoint to produce the same outcome as calling
  REQ-028/029's validators directly on the same graph. That is only
  *structurally* guaranteed if the route contains no validation logic at all —
  so it contains none, and this function contains no rule of its own either.

  Behaviour:

    1. `get_by_id/2` — prefix-scoped. `{:error, :not_found}` propagates
       unchanged; that is also the cross-tenant case (INV-5 — the route
       renders it as a detail-free 404, byte-identical to a genuinely absent
       id, on the same code path and with the same query count).
    2. `Letflow.Definitions.Graph.from_map/1`. `:error` ->
       `{:error, :graph_structure_invalid}` — a stored graph that will not
       even parse.
    3. Exactly these three, in this order:
       `Graph.validate_graph/1` (REQ-028 structural),
       `Graph.validate_node_attributes/1` (REQ-029 node attributes),
       `Graph.validate_edge_conditions/1` (REQ-029 edge conditions).
    4. The three `:violations` lists are concatenated in that order.
       Duplicates are **not** deduplicated: the three validators produce
       disjoint `Graph.Violation.code()` sets. `valid` is `violations == []`.

  **Adds no rule of its own, and calls no other validator.** In particular it
  does **not** call
  `Letflow.Definitions.ServiceScopeValidator.validate/3`, which `activate/2`
  does call. Service-scope validation needs an injected `Lookup.t()` this
  endpoint has no source for, and including it would break AC4's equality with
  "REQ-028/029's validators directly". That exclusion is deliberate, and
  `activate/2` remains its owning path.

  Issues exactly one query (`get_by_id/2`); everything after step 1 is pure.

  Counts `process_definitions` rows by `status`, scoped to `opts[:prefix]`.

  Every status in the closed enum is present in the returned map,
  zero-valued if unseen, so the response shape is stable.

  The `group_by`/`select` is composed over the **schema field**, never the raw
  column, so Ecto's enum loader maps stored values back to atoms before the
  zero-fill sees them. `process_definitions.status` is a bare-atom enum where
  the distinction would not bite, but
  `Letflow.Engine.count_instances_by_status/1` and `count_tasks_by_status/1`
  operate on keyword-mapped enums where it very much does — all three are
  written the same way on purpose.

  `opts[:prefix]` is validated via
  `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.tenant_id_for_schema_name/1` **before** the
  query is constructed, the same guard `Letflow.EventStore.read_global/1`
  uses. Composed with `Ecto.Query` and bound parameters only (INV-7).

  The SINGLE insert path into the tenant-scoped `variable_schemas` table
  (`Letflow.Engine.VariableSchema`, REQ-109). REQ-078's solution-pack install
  and REQ-082's definition import both call THIS function; neither adds a
  second insert path.

  The invariant is about INSERT PATHS, not about text: the only `Repo` insert
  against `Letflow.Engine.VariableSchema` anywhere in `lib/` is the one inside
  this function, and no module under `lib/letflow/routers/` performs a `Repo`
  call of any kind. Documentation that NAMES this table or this function is
  not a second insert path -- route moduledocs are required to name both, so
  they point a reader here. See `lib/letflow/design/req078-supporting-routes.md`
  §18.1 for the three mechanical checks that verify this, and INV-VS-1.

  Behaviour, in this exact order (steps 1-5 issue **zero** queries, so a
  malformed request never reaches the database):

    1. `opts[:prefix]` missing/nil/empty -> `{:error, :missing_prefix}`;
       `definition_id` not UUID-shaped -> `{:error, :invalid_definition_id}`.
    2. `entries == []` -> `{:ok, 0}`. (A pack with no `variable_schemas` array
       is normal, not an error.)
    3. A blank or whitespace-only `variable_key` at index `i` ->
       `{:error, {:blank_variable_key, i}}`; a `variable_key` at index `i`
       longer than #{@max_variable_key_bytes} bytes ->
       `{:error, {:variable_key_too_long, i}}`. The bound is the width of the
       `variable_schemas.variable_key` column (`varchar(255)`), applied in
       BYTES, which is the same conservative rule `create/2` applies to a
       definition `name`: Postgres counts `varchar(n)` in characters, so a
       byte bound can never admit a value the column would reject. Without
       this check a caller-supplied pack document reaches the INSERT and
       Postgres raises `Postgrex.Error` (SQLSTATE 22001) -- a bare 500 where
       every comparable pack defect returns a typed 422.
    4. A `variable_key` duplicated **within `entries`** ->
       `{:error, {:duplicate_variable_key, key}}`, checked before any insert --
       the database's `uq_variable_schema_definition_key` would otherwise
       surface it as an opaque changeset error mid-transaction.
    5. Well-formedness of every entry's `json_schema`, via
       `Letflow.Definitions.JsonSchemaShape.check/1` -- the same predicate
       `Letflow.Engine.VariableSchema.changeset/2` itself applies. The first
       failure aborts and nothing is written:
       `{:error, {:not_well_formed, variable_key, path}}` or
       `{:error, {:schema_too_deep, variable_key}}`.
    PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
    6. Insert via `Letflow.Engine.VariableSchema.changeset/2` -- REQ-109's
       changeset, not a second one -- with `prefix: opts[:prefix]` and
       `on_conflict: :nothing, conflict_target: [:definition_id,
       :variable_key]`, porting R-Co's
       `ON CONFLICT (definition_id, variable_key) DO NOTHING`
       (`src/solution/store.zig:485`) exactly.

  All inserts run in one `Ecto.Multi`, so the function is all-or-nothing.
  `Letflow.Repo.transaction/1` **joins an already-open transaction** rather
  than opening a nested one, so when the solution-pack install calls this
  inside its own transaction, the schema registration and the definitions that
  install created commit or roll back together (design OQ-5's fixed
  guarantee). Called outside a transaction, the same call wraps the inserts in
  one of their own.

  Returns `{:ok, count}`, where `count` counts rows **actually inserted** --
  a row absorbed by `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` is not counted. The mechanism is
  `created_at`, a `read_after_writes: true` column: a skipped insert returns no
  row from `RETURNING`, so the field stays `nil`.

  **Row scoping (INV-VS-3).** Rows are keyed to the `definition_id` argument. A
  pack carrying N definitions calls this function N times with N distinct ids,
  so the row sets are disjoint and cannot collide with REQ-082 importing a
  different definition.

  `create/2` plus, atomically in the same transaction, a `register_variable_schemas/3`
  call for `entries` (REQ-109's obligation on the create write path -- see this
  module's moduledoc pointer and `docs/requirements.yaml`'s REQ-082 entry). `entries`
  is typically `[]` (most creates carry no `variable_schemas`), in which case this is
  exactly `create/2` wrapped in a transaction for no reason other than a uniform
  return shape with the non-empty case.

  A `create/2` failure never reaches `register_variable_schemas/3` (the `with` chain
  short-circuits). A `register_variable_schemas/3` failure rolls back the just-inserted
  definition row too -- a definition is never left on disk with a still-invalid or
  partially-registered `variable_schemas` set (INV-8).

  Returns `create/2`'s error union unchanged on a create failure, or
  `{:error, {:variable_schema_registration_failed, variable_schema_error()}}` on a
  registration failure -- tagged distinctly so the caller (the router) can render each
  differently even though `create_error()` and `variable_schema_error()` are disjoint
  atom-vs-tuple spaces that could not otherwise collide.

  Updates a DRAFT process definition -- the shared backing function for both
  `PUT /definitions/:id` and `PATCH /definitions/:id`. See `update_attrs()`'s own
  typedoc for the presence-controls-touch contract.

  Every subsequent transition off `:draft` is a guarded single-statement
  `WHERE id = $1 AND status = 'draft'` UPDATE (matching
  `Letflow.Definitions.ProcessDefinition`'s own moduledoc, "status is never castable
  from caller input" / "a load-then-update would reintroduce the lost-update race"),
  never a `Repo.get/2`-then-changeset read-modify-write. Steps that only inspect
  `attrs` (name/version presence+shape, graph structural/node/edge validation via the
  same three validators `create/2` runs) issue **zero** queries and run entirely
  before the guarded UPDATE, so a malformed request never reaches the database
  (INV-8, matching `create/2`'s own "zero DB calls on a validation failure" contract).

  A well-formed request against a row that is missing, or present but not `:draft`,
  cannot be told apart by the UPDATE's own row count (`{0, _}` either way) -- resolved
  by a `Repo.get/2` fallback lookup that distinguishes `{:error, :not_found}` (row
  absent -- collapses a cross-tenant id with a genuinely-absent one, INV-5, since
  `Repo.get/2` is itself prefix-scoped) from `{:error, :not_draft}` (row present, wrong
  status), exactly mirroring `run_transition/4`'s own `fallback_lookup/2` above.

  `attrs[:variable_schemas]`, if present (even `[]`), REPLACES this definition's
  entire `variable_schemas` row set inside the SAME transaction as the UPDATE --
  existing rows for this `definition_id` are deleted first, then
  `register_variable_schemas/3` inserts the new set. This is what makes a re-PUT with
  an omitted `variable_key` leave no row for that key (REQ-082's AC9): the delete has
  no "keep unless" branch, it clears every row for this `definition_id` before the
  fresh insert. Absent entirely (no `:variable_schemas` key in `attrs`), the existing
  `variable_schemas` rows are left untouched -- a PUT/PATCH that does not mention
  variable schemas is not a statement that there are none.
