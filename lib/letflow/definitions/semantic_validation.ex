defmodule Letflow.Definitions.SemanticValidation do
  @moduledoc """
  Semantic validation of `EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY` edge conditions against a
  process definition's own declared `variable_schemas` (REQ-372,
  `lib/letflow/design/req372-semantic-decision-rule-validation.md` — the
  gate-approved design this module implements). Two independent violation
  classes, collected together in a single pass, never short-circuiting on
  the first one found:

    1. **Field-existence** — an edge condition references a variable root
       segment (`{:var, path}`, checked at `hd(path)` only — see "Nested
       variable references" below) not present among the definition's
       declared `variable_schemas` keys.
    2. **Type-compatibility** — an edge condition compares (`{:cmp, op,
       left, right}`, all six `Letflow.Engine.Expr.cmp_op/0` values treated
       identically) two operands whose declared/literal type families are
       not comparable — see "The comparable/non-comparable type-pair table"
       below for the full table stated in prose, as this moduledoc is
       required to do explicitly rather than leave to test coverage.

  Sibling to `Letflow.Definitions.SubProcessInterface` and
  `Letflow.Definitions.FormSchemaExpressions`: a pure function taking a
  `Letflow.Definitions.Graph.t()` (plus this module's one extra input, the
  declared fields) and returning `Letflow.Definitions.Graph.result()`,
  consumed by `Letflow.Definitions` rather than by `Graph` itself.

  ## Purity

  Depends on Elixir/Erlang stdlib and `Letflow.Engine.Expr` only — no
  `Letflow.Repo`, no `Ecto.Changeset`, no `Logger.*`, no clock read, no
  HTTP/file/process-mailbox call anywhere, matching `Graph`'s own zero-I/O
  contract. Reading `variable_schemas` fresh (so this pass genuinely
  re-runs in full on every call, never against a cached prior result) is
  entirely the caller's job — see `Letflow.Engine.VariableSchema.fetch_schemas/3`,
  already public, already a plain uncached `Repo.all/2`, called fresh by
  `Letflow.Definitions.activate/2` and `Letflow.Definitions.validate_definition_graph/2`
  on every invocation.

  ## Ordering contract

  This module assumes, but does not verify, that `Graph.validate_graph/1`
  **and** `Graph.validate_edge_conditions/1` have already been run against
  the same `graph` value and both returned `valid: true`. It does not call
  either. `Graph.validate_edge_conditions/1`'s CHK-17
  (`check_cel_syntax/1`) is what guarantees every non-blank edge
  `condition` is syntactically valid CEL — `translate_cel_to_expr/1` +
  `parse_strict/1` are guaranteed to succeed only under that precondition.
  Calling `validate/2` against a graph with a grammar-invalid condition will
  not crash: an edge whose condition fails to translate/parse is
  defensively skipped, contributing zero violations for that edge from this
  pass — the CEL-syntax violation is CHK-17's to report, not this module's
  job to duplicate or paper over. Enforcing "run `validate_graph/1` ->
  `validate_edge_conditions/1` -> `SemanticValidation.validate/2`, in that
  order" is entirely the caller's job.

  ## The comparable/non-comparable type-pair table

  Every declared `variable_schemas` field and every literal operand
  resolves to one `type_family()`: `:numeric` (JSON Schema `"number"` or
  `"integer"` — **there is no distinct "money" type in this codebase**; a
  money-valued field is declared as `{"type": "number"}` with, by
  convention, an inert `"format"` annotation, so "money" is simply the
  `:numeric` family for this check's purposes), `:string` (`"string"`),
  `:boolean` (`"boolean"`), `:array` (`"array"`), or `:object`
  (`"object"`). A comparison is exempted from the table entirely (no
  violation, regardless of family) when either operand is a `null` literal
  (a `field == null` / `field != null` guard is always legitimate), an
  unresolved variable reference (already independently reported by the
  field-existence check against the same edge — no redundant second
  violation for the same root cause), or otherwise resolves to `:unknown`
  (an arithmetic expression, a builtin function call, a declared field with
  no recognized or a polymorphic multi-value `"type"`). For every other
  comparison, both operands are one of `:numeric | :string | :boolean |
  :array | :object`, and the full table is:

  | vs.      | numeric   | string    | boolean   | array     | object    |
  |----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
  | numeric  | OK        | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION |
  | string   | VIOLATION | OK        | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION |
  | boolean  | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | OK        | VIOLATION | VIOLATION |
  | array    | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION |
  | object   | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION | VIOLATION |

  In words: each of the three primitive families (`:numeric`, `:string`,
  `:boolean`) is comparable only with itself; `:array` and `:object` are
  never comparable with anything, including themselves, in this grammar
  (REQ-197's `eval/2` has no defined structural-equality semantic for a CEL
  condition, and an `array`/`object` operand can only ever have reached a
  gateway condition through a declaration mistake). At minimum, this
  records numeric/money vs. text/string as non-comparable, satisfying this
  requirement's own explicit floor.

  ## Data-flow class (REQ-455, `:variable_never_collected`)

  A third violation class, computed in the same pass (and silenced by the same
  empty-`declared_fields` exemption). For a HUMAN_TASK-sourced edge with a
  non-blank condition, a variable root that is not a declared field is reported
  only when it is *certain* no path can set it: no node in the ancestor-or-self
  set of the edge's source may write it. SERVICE_TASK always may write (opaque
  response); a HUMAN_TASK may write iff its `form_schema` has no `properties`
  map or lists the root; a SUB_PROCESS may write iff it has no parseable
  `interface` or its `interface.outputs` names the root. Declared fields are
  treated as possible start inputs. Where some path may set it, the judgment is
  PROCESS-AUDITOR's (REQ-456), not this pass's.

  ## HUMAN_TASK routing/assignment-by-field: OUT OF SCOPE for the first two classes (explicit, not a silent omission)

  The field-existence and type-compatibility classes only cover HUMAN_TASK edge
  conditions via the data-flow class above.

  This module's checks walk **only** `EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY` edge conditions.
  No HUMAN_TASK attribute is walked, and no HUMAN_TASK-routing-by-field (or
  assignment-by-field) mechanism is designed or implemented here. This is
  a deliberate, grep-verified decision, not an oversight: no such
  mechanism exists anywhere in `lib/letflow/` today.
  `check_human_task_role/1` (`Letflow.Definitions.Graph`'s CHK-09) requires
  a HUMAN_TASK node's `attributes["role"]` to be a non-blank **plain
  string constant**, never an `Letflow.Engine.Expr` expression, and no
  HUMAN_TASK attribute is ever routed through `Letflow.Engine.Expr` at
  activation, task-creation, or anywhere else in the engine. There is
  therefore no existing "authored rule expression" on a HUMAN_TASK node for
  this pass to validate against `variable_schemas` at all — inventing one
  would require a separate, prerequisite requirement (a new node-attribute
  shape, a new consumption point in the engine, its own grammar/scope
  decisions) before any validation of it could even be designed. This gap
  is filed separately and is not solved here.

  ## Empty-declared_fields exemption (REQ-372 §2.5 amendment)

  When `declared_fields == %{}` (the definition has zero `variable_schemas` rows —
  `VariableSchema.fetch_schemas/3` returned an empty map), `validate/2` skips both
  violation classes entirely and returns `%{valid: true, violations: []}`
  unconditionally, without walking any node or edge. `VariableSchema` registration is
  optional; a process that never registered a schema has no schema to validate
  references or comparisons against, so treating "zero fields declared" as "every
  reference is a typo" would invert this requirement's own intent and would block
  activation for every pre-existing, unregistered process definition. This guard lives
  inside `validate/2` itself, checked before any edge is walked, so both call sites
  (`Letflow.Definitions.activate/2` and `Letflow.Definitions.validate_definition_graph/2`)
  get it uniformly with no per-caller special-casing. For any `declared_fields` with at
  least one entry, behavior is exactly as specified above, unchanged.

  **Exception (REQ-461, REQ-459 design section 1.3):** the required-output check
  (`required_output_schema_violations/2`, `:required_output_without_variable_schema`)
  still runs when `declared_fields == %{}`; a definition that declares
  `required_outputs` and registers no `variable_schemas` at all is exactly the defect
  it reports. It is the only class the empty-schema clause can return.

  ## Required-output classes (REQ-461)

  `required_output_schema_violations/2` (a violation, see above) and
  `decision_key_warnings/2` (a permanent WARNING string prefixed
  `decision_key_not_required:`, never a violation: a conditional edge of an
  EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY or HUMAN_TASK reads a key some upstream HUMAN_TASK's form collects
  while no upstream HUMAN_TASK lists it in `required_outputs`). The warnings are
  aggregated by `Letflow.Definitions.ValidationWarnings`, not returned by `validate/2`.

  ## Nested variable references

  `VariableSchema.variable_key` is a single flat string with no
  nested-path concept — `fetch_schemas/3` selects one row per
  `(definition_id, variable_key)` pair, not per JSON-pointer path into a
  schema's `"properties"`. A multi-segment reference
  (`variables.customer.name`, `path == ["customer", "name"]`) is therefore
  checked only at its root segment (`"customer"`); whether `"customer"`'s
  own declared `json_schema["properties"]` also declares `"name"` is never
  checked by this pass. That would be a materially different check
  (validating against a nested schema, not "is this top-level field
  declared") and is left to a distinct follow-up requirement.
