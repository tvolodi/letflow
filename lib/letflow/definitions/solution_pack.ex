defmodule Letflow.Definitions.SolutionPack do
  @moduledoc """
  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  Solution-pack export and install — the backing context for
  `Letflow.Routers.SolutionPacks` (REQ-078, design
  `lib/letflow/design/req078-supporting-routes.md` §8). Ports the parts of
  R-Co's `src/solution/store.zig` (`exportPack` L46, `installPack` L284) that
  Letflow has subsystems for.

  ## This module had to be BUILT, not merely routed to

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  REQ-078's description called all six of its route modules "a one-to-three
  handler surface over existing context functions". That was true of five of
  them and false of this one: R-Co's two solution-pack handlers are thin only
  because they delegate to roughly 700 lines of `src/solution/store.zig`, of
  which Letflow had ported **none**. REQ-041 delivered the pack-update
  three-way diff (`Letflow.Definitions.compute_pack_update_plan/5`) plus three
  global Ecto schemas; `Letflow.Definitions.SolutionPackInstall`'s entire
  public surface is `insert_changeset/2`. `Letflow.Definitions.ExportImport`
  is a **single-definition** path and is not a substitute for a
  multi-definition pack document; it is reused here only for its
  `bpm/definition/v1` schema-version constant, so there is one version string
  in the codebase rather than two.

  ## What a Letflow pack document carries, and what it drops

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  R-Co's `SolutionPackDocument` (`src/api/routes/solution_packs.zig:153-351`)
  has four content arrays. Letflow supports three of them (all but
  `service_catalog_entries`), plus a fifth section, `entity_definitions`,
  that R-Co's document never had (REQ-303–306, decision
  `0026-solution-pack-entity-definitions-section.md`):

    * `definitions` — supported (`process_definitions`, REQ-027/030).
    * `variable_schemas` — supported (`variable_schemas`, REQ-109). This is
      the whole point of REQ-078's AC8: install is one of the two write paths
      that must populate that table, and without it the table ships empty and
      REQ-061's variable-schema rejection branch stays unreachable
      (ISS-0063 / GH#212).
    * `service_catalog_entries` — **still not supported, and now settled as
      permanently NOT PERMITTED**, not merely unowned. A
      `Letflow.ServiceCatalog` now exists (REQ-191), but which
      tenant-visibility policy a packed catalog entry should install under
      — tenant-scoped-to-the-installer only (consistent with every other
      `install/3` write) or a `scope: :global`, cross-tenant-visible entry
      (which no other `install/3` write does, and which raises its own
      write-authorization question) — is decided by
      `docs/migration/decisions/0027-solution-pack-service-catalog-install-policy.md`:
      the rejection is permanent, and any needed service-catalog entry is
      provisioned out-of-band, through the existing `POST /service-catalog`
      route (gated `:AdminServicesManage`, PLATFORM_ADMIN-only in the current
      role matrix), not through a pack. This bullet previously deferred the
      decision to REQ-192, on the reasoning that resolving
      `service_catalog_entries` alongside the catalog's HTTP
      write-authorization policy (SVC-04: `:AdminServicesManage`) would
      avoid inventing a second, possibly inconsistent authorization stance
      later. That deferral was stale: REQ-192 is `done` and landed the
      service-catalog route surface *without* lifting this pack restriction.
      0027 closes that gap permanently rather than reopening it. S10's gaps
      4 (email) and 5 (PDF + QR rendering) are no longer blocked on this
      policy — see
      `docs/migration/stage-10-bilimbaga-vertical.md`'s "Open questions"
      section, which records the same thing. Export still always emits `[]`;
      install still **rejects** a non-empty array with
      `{:error, :unsupported_pack_section}` rather than silently discarding
      tenant-supplied content or guessing at a policy this module was never
      asked to decide.
    * `manifest.required_roles` — supported, **read-only**: it produces the
      advisory `role_mapping_checklist` (see `install/3`). No role is created
      and no install is ever rejected because of it.
    * `entity_definitions` — supported (REQ-304 export, REQ-305 install).
      Not part of R-Co's original document; carries named
      `Letflow.Entities.EntityDefinition` records, installed `:inactive`
      only, per decision 0026.

  ## Tenant scoping (INV-1)

  Every read `export/3` performs and every write `install/3` performs runs
  with `opts[:prefix]`, which the route derives solely from
  `Letflow.Api.Context.scoped_repo_opts/1`, i.e. solely from the authenticated
  token's `tenant_id`. No function here takes a tenant id, schema name or slug
  as a caller-supplied argument. The single exception to prefix-scoping is the
  one `solution_pack_installs` row, whose table is **global** by REQ-041's own
  design — and its `tenant_id` is *derived* from the resolved prefix via
  `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.tenant_id_for_schema_name/1`, never accepted as
  a caller-supplied field.

  A definition id belonging to another tenant is invisible in the caller's
  schema, so an export naming it can only produce
  `{:error, {:definition_not_found, id}}` — never that tenant's artefact in
  the document.

  ## Install is ALL-OR-NOTHING. There is no "skipped" definition

  `installed_definition.status` is **always** `"installed"`.
  `Letflow.Definitions.create/2` has no upsert, no skip and no idempotent
  branch: it inserts, or it returns `{:error, :duplicate_name_version}` when
  `uq_definition_version` fires, which the route maps to a **409 that aborts
  the entire install**. Every packed definition that reaches the result map
  was inserted by that call; any that was not aborted the transaction before a
  result map existed.

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  Consequence: **re-installing a pack whose `(name, version)` pairs already
  exist in the caller's schema is a 409, not a no-op.** This is a real
  behavioural divergence from R-Co, whose `buildIdempotentResult`
  (`src/solution/store.zig:682`, called from `:337`) returns a synthetic
  success for an already-installed pack. Letflow has no such path, and
  `uq_solution_pack_install_active` additionally makes a second install of the
  same `(tenant_id, pack_id)` a `{:error, :duplicate_pack_install}`. Named as
  a deliberate non-port, not left as an accident. If idempotent re-install is
  wanted later it needs its own requirement; it is not smuggled in here.

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  `status` is nonetheless kept as a field rather than dropped, so the response
  shape stays compatible with R-Co's `serializeInstallResult`
  (`solution_packs.zig:426-463`) and a future idempotent-install requirement
  has somewhere to put `"skipped"` without changing the wire shape.

  ## `VARIABLE_SCHEMA_CONFLICT` is a deliberate non-port — and it is unreachable

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  R-Co pre-checks for a conflicting `variable_schemas` row before install
  (`store.zig:419-441`). Letflow has nothing to check, and the branch could
  not fire if it existed:

    1. `Letflow.Definitions.ProcessDefinition`'s primary key is
       `@primary_key {:id, :binary_id, autogenerate: true}`, so every
       successful `create/2` mints a fresh, previously-unused `definition_id`.
    2. `create/2` never returns a pre-existing row — it inserts or errors.
    3. Step 7 below writes `variable_schemas` rows keyed **only** to ids
       produced in step 6, resolved through the
       `source_definition_id -> new_definition_id` mapping.
    4. Therefore no row an install writes can collide on
       `(definition_id, variable_key)` — the id half is new in every case. The
       `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` inside
       `Letflow.Definitions.register_variable_schemas/3` can only ever absorb
       a duplicate *within the same pack's own entries*, which that function
       rejects earlier with `{:error, {:duplicate_variable_key, key}}`.

  **Standing condition:** this non-port is valid *only while* install creates
  every definition it writes schemas for. If a later requirement adds an
  install mode that attaches variable schemas to a pre-existing definition,
  the conflict becomes reachable and must be reinstated.

  ## Other deliberate non-ports

    PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
    * **`409 CATALOG_CONFLICT`** (`solution_packs.zig:135`) — there is no
      catalog to conflict with (S6 service catalog).
    PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
    * **`409 TenantInactive`** (`solution_packs.zig:127-134`) —
      `Letflow.Plugs.TenantStatus` runs in `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline`, before
      any sub-router, and rejects an inactive tenant's request with
      `403 tenant_inactive` for every method. A 409 branch here could never
      fire.
    PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
    * **`MODULE_NON_EXPORTABLE`** (`solution_packs.zig:83`) — Letflow has no
      process-module packaging (`process_modules.zig`, S5).
    * **503 `PoolExhausted`** — Ecto/DBConnection surfaces pool exhaustion as
      a raised `DBConnection.ConnectionError`, not an error tuple, so there is
      no tuple to match and a 503 clause would be unreachable.

  ## Known gap

  `manifest.required_roles` is always `[]` on export: nothing in Letflow
  declares per-definition roles yet. The field exists so the wire shape is
  stable and so an install document that *does* carry required roles (from
  another system, or a future Letflow that populates them) produces a
  meaningful checklist.

  Installs a pack document into the caller's own tenant schema

  `document` is the **raw decoded JSON body** (string keys) — this function
  owns the structural parse so the route layer stays a thin dispatcher, and a
  shape failure surfaces as the typed `{:error, :invalid_pack_document}`
  rather than as hand-rolled parsing in a `Plug.Router` module.

  Order of operations. Steps 1-3 issue **zero** queries, so a malformed
  document never reaches the database:

    1. `service_catalog_entries` non-empty -> `{:error, :unsupported_pack_section}`.
    PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):

       `{:error, {:unknown_schema_version, actual}}` (R-Co:
       `INVALID_PACK_DOCUMENT`, `solution_packs.zig:168-172`).
    3. Well-formedness pre-check on every `variable_schemas` entry:
       `schema_content` is decoded with `Jason.decode/1` and checked by
       `Letflow.Definitions.JsonSchemaShape.check/1`. Any failure aborts with
       `{:error, {:malformed_variable_schema, schema_name, reason}}` and
       **nothing is written**.

  Then, inside one `Letflow.Repo.transaction/1`:

    4. (No conflict pre-check — see the moduledoc; it is unreachable here.)
    5. Insert the global `solution_pack_installs` row via
       `Letflow.Definitions.SolutionPackInstall.insert_changeset/2`, with
       `tenant_id` **derived** from `opts[:prefix]`. Its
       `uq_solution_pack_install_active` partial unique index surfaces as
       `{:error, :duplicate_pack_install}`.
    6. `Letflow.Definitions.create/2` per packed definition, with
       `name: process_key` and `created_by: actor_id`, recording the
       `source_definition_id -> new_definition_id` mapping.

       `definition_id` resolves through that mapping. An entry naming a
       definition the pack does not carry is skipped and reported in
       `warnings`, matching R-Co's `continue` at `store.zig:483`.
    8. Build the advisory `role_mapping_checklist` and commit.

  Any error in steps 5-7 rolls the whole transaction back, so a rejected
  variable schema also un-creates the definitions the same install made.

  # the install-time visibility policy a packed entry would need; that is
  # stale. REQ-192 is done and landed the service-catalog route surface
  # WITHOUT lifting this restriction. That gap is now closed, permanently, by
  # docs/migration/decisions/0027-solution-pack-service-catalog-install-policy.md:
  # the policy is settled as permanently NOT PERMITTED, not unowned. Any
  # needed service-catalog entry is provisioned out-of-band, through the
  # existing POST /service-catalog route (gated :AdminServicesManage,
  # PLATFORM_ADMIN-only in the current role matrix), not through a pack.
  # S10's gaps 4 and 5 are no longer blocked on this policy (see
  # docs/migration/stage-10-bilimbaga-vertical.md, "Open questions"). This
  # hard-fail stays permanently, per 0027.

  # joint `%{service_catalog_entries: [], entity_definitions: []}` passing
  # clause -- i.e. requiring entity_definitions to ALSO be empty. Implemented
  # literally that would make `entity_definitions` un-installable through
  # `install/3` forever (this clause runs before `run_install/5`, so
  # `create_packed_entity_definitions/3`, §4, would be permanently
  # unreachable), directly contradicting AC1 and the design doc's own §4.
  # `entity_definitions` is a newly *supported* section (that is this whole
  # requirement's point), not an unsupported one like
  # `service_catalog_entries` still is -- so only the latter gates here.
