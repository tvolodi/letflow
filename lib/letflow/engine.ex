  @moduledoc """
  Context module for EE-01 (`create/2`) — starting a new process instance.
  See `lib/letflow/design/req045-instance-start-engine-shell.md` for the full
  design this module implements; this moduledoc restates the points that
  design's §2 requires to be stated here verbatim in substance.

  ## Process-vs-row decision (AC5, AC6)

  Whether a running instance is a supervised `:gen_statem` process or a
  plain transactional context module was this stage's largest open design
  question (`docs/migration/stage-3-instance-engine.md`'s second Early
  finding). This module resolves it for EE-01's own scope only: `create/2`
  is a plain function, no process — see the design doc §1 for the full
  reasoning (every write EE-01 performs is already transactional; there is
  no multi-step conversation a caller has across several calls the way
  `submitted -> approve` in `Letflow.ProcessInstance` does; no timer, no
  backpressure, no external-plugin call). The answer may legitimately differ
  for later engine subsystems (REQ-056 service task dispatch, REQ-057 plugin
  registry), which the same finding names as the strong case for a process;
  this module does not pre-empt those requirements' own decisions.

  Concretely, for the two existing modules this decision bears on:

    * `lib/letflow/process_instance.ex` is **superseded, not extended**. Its
      hardcoded four-atom state graph becomes REQ-027 definition data,
      snapshotted per instance by REQ-033. `Letflow.ProcessInstance` itself
      is not deleted by this requirement — REQ-046 owns physically removing
      it; this requirement only stops adding to its pattern and builds the
      real replacement alongside it.
    * `lib/letflow/instance_supervisor.ex` is **generalized, not
      superseded** — but not by this requirement, since this requirement
      introduces no process for it to supervise. Its `DynamicSupervisor`
      shape is confirmed still correct in principle for whichever later S3
      requirement (REQ-056/REQ-057) does need a supervised process.
      `Letflow.Engine` does not modify `instance_supervisor.ex` at all.
    * `Letflow.Events.TransitionEvent` (and its migration) is **deliberately
      kept in place, not retired by this requirement.** REQ-023's `events`
      table is the durable event log for the new engine (this module
      appends `INSTANCE_STARTED` there); `TransitionEvent` is
      `Letflow.ProcessInstance`'s own private log with no reader or writer
      outside that module. Retiring it is REQ-046's job, bundled with
      `Letflow.ProcessInstance`'s own removal.

  ## HTTP is out of scope (AC7 / scope boundary)

  `POST /api/v1/instances` and every other HTTP route belong to S4
  (api-surface) — this module builds a context-module function only,
  returning tagged tuples, matching the boundary every other S2-S3 context
  module already established.

  ## Activation loops to a stable resting state (AC7, updated post-REQ-050/051)

  `create/2` drives `Letflow.Engine.Transition.transition/3` from a worklist
  loop (`advance_until_stable/4`), one hop per call — matching
  `Transition`'s own "single hop per call" contract (its moduledoc) —
  rather than assuming any fixed hop count. After each hop it diffs the
  token list against what it was immediately before that hop
  (`tokens_needing_dispatch/3`) to decide which token_ids still need a
  dispatch call: a token needs another hop exactly when it just arrived
  somewhere its own node's dispatch hasn't run yet (whether via a plain
  :START/gateway advance, or as one of several fresh tokens produced by a
  `:PARALLEL_GATEWAY` split or join) — never when it stayed at the same
  `node_id` (`:HUMAN_TASK`'s genuine "no automatic outgoing traversal"
  stop) or was removed outright (`:END`, or a join's `:wait` outcome). The
  loop ends the instant the worklist is empty: either no token remains
  (the instance reached `:END` and completed) or every remaining token
  sits on a genuine waiting state or a node type this engine doesn't
  dispatch yet (`:SERVICE_TASK`/`:TIMER`/`:SUB_PROCESS`, surfaced as
  `{:error, {:activation_failed, {:node_type_not_yet_implemented, ...}}}`).
  A defensive, generously-sized hop bound
  (`length(graph.nodes) * 4 + 10`) guards against ever looping forever
  should a malformed/cyclic graph somehow reach this code despite
  REQ-028's structural validators rejecting true cycles — see design doc
  §9 OQ-1a (updated) for the full history of this limitation.

  ## `tenant_id` is validated, never persisted

  `attrs` never accepts a `:tenant_id` (or `"tenant_id"`) key.
  `opts[:prefix]` is resolved via
  `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.tenant_id_for_schema_name/1` purely to prove it
  names a well-formed tenant schema before any I/O — the derived value is
  not stored anywhere by this module, since none of
  `instance_projections`/`tokens`/`tasks` carries a `tenant_id` column
  (Decision 0006 D2).

  ## REQ-059 (PIN-01..PIN-04) — pin resolution runs before any write

  `start_instance/5`'s call order is, in this exact sequence: build the
  graph once (`build_graph/1`, reused by both this step and `activate/3`
  below rather than built twice); `Letflow.Engine.PinResolver.resolve/4`
  (enumerates and resolves every `SERVICE_TASK`/`SUB_PROCESS` catalog/module
  reference plus exactly one `variable_schema` entry, against an injectable
  `PinResolver.Lookup.t()` — see `pin_lookup/2`/`pin_overrides/1` below);
  `PinResolver.validate_initial_variables/2` (rejects initial variables
  violating the resolved `variable_schema`, reusing REQ-024's
  `Letflow.EventStore.Registry.JsonSchema.validate/2`); `parent_pins/2` +
  `PinResolver.apply_inheritance/2` (child pin inheritance when
  `attrs[:parent_instance_id]` is given, `{:ok, own_pins, []}` unchanged
  otherwise); **only then** `create_snapshot/3` — the first step in the
  whole sequence that performs any `Repo` write. A failed resolution,
  validation, or parent-pin lookup therefore writes zero rows anywhere
  (`instance_definition_snapshots` included) by construction, never by a
  rollback — see `lib/letflow/design/req059-pin-resolver.md` §3 for the full
  call-order specification this implements verbatim. The resolved
  `pins`/`conflicts` are threaded through `activate/3` (its own signature
  changed to `activate(instance_id, graph, initial_variables)`, taking the
  already-built graph instead of rebuilding it) into `persist/10`, which
  embeds them into the `INSTANCE_STARTED` event payload
  (`append_instance_started_event/8`) — see
  `Letflow.Engine.PinResolver`'s own moduledoc for the full PIN-01..PIN-04
  algorithm and its named SCOPE GAPs.

  ## `complete_task/3` (EE-04, REQ-048) — HTTP and assignee authorization are
  ## out of scope

  `POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/complete`'s HTTP status-code mapping (404/409/422
  for `:task_not_found`/`{:task_not_pending, _}`/`:invalid_output_variables`
  respectively) is S4 (api-surface) scope — `complete_task/3` returns tagged
  tuples only, exactly as `Letflow.EventStore.append/2`'s `is_duplicate`
  boolean already left the 200-vs-201 choice to S4. Whether the calling
  `TASK_WORKER` is the task's own `assignee_ref` (HTTP 403 otherwise, per
  IDN-03's role matrix) is **not checked anywhere in this module** — that is
  the S4 auth plug's job, per REQ-021's precedent; `complete_task/3` performs
  no assignee comparison and accepts `attrs.actor_id` as already-authorized
  by the caller. See `lib/letflow/design/req048-task-completion.md` for the
  full design.

  ## Output-variable schema validation at the merge call site (REQ-109)

  `merge_output_variables/7` builds a real `variable_validations` map via
  `Letflow.Engine.VariableSchema.variable_validations/5` and passes it to
  `Letflow.Engine.VariableMerge.merge/3`, which makes REQ-061's
  `{:rejected, …}` → `Letflow.Engine.ExecutionError.append_multi/3` branch
  reachable through the real completion path for the first time (ISS-0063 /
  GH#212). Storage-side rationale — the table, the three R-Co "schema"
  concepts, the deferred registration path — lives in
  `Letflow.Engine.VariableSchema`'s own moduledoc; what follows is the
  engine-side half.

  ### The former hardcoded `nil` was design-sanctioned, not a defect

  Before REQ-109 this call site passed `variable_validations: nil` literally.
  That conformed to its own gate-approved design contract:
  `lib/letflow/design/req049-variable-merge.md` §7.3 states outright that
  "until that requirement exists, every real caller of `merge/3` legitimately
  passes `variable_validations: nil`." **REQ-109 is that requirement.** The
  `nil` was the documented placeholder for a lookup that had not been built,
  not a regression — it had already been re-filed as one twice, and this
  paragraph exists to stop a third time.

  ### Why `JsonSchema.validate/2` rather than REQ-024's `validate_payload/3`

  `Letflow.EventStore.Registry.JsonSchema.validate/2` is called directly, and
  no JSON Schema dependency is added to `mix.exs`. This is a deliberate,
  stated deviation from REQ-049 AC4's *wording* whose *substance* it still
  satisfies: `JsonSchema.validate/2` **is** `validate_payload/3`'s own
  internal pure delegate (`lib/letflow/event_store/registry.ex:147` is
  literally `case JsonSchema.validate(decoded, schema) do`), so no second JSON
  Schema implementation is introduced. `validate_payload/3` itself is bypassed
  because it is bound to `get_type/2` → `event_type_registry`
  (`registry.ex:165-175`), and REQ-109 resolved variable-schema storage as a
  *dedicated* table rather than an `event_type_registry` reuse — calling it
  would force exactly the variable-key-to-event-type name mangling that
  resolution rejected.

  Three consequences for `req049-variable-merge.md`:

    * **§7.1 is superseded.** Its `{"value" => raw}` wrapper convention is
      replaced by `%{key => value}` against
      `%{"type" => "object", "properties" => %{key => schema}, "required" =>
      [key]}` — the shape already proven at
      `lib/letflow/engine/sub_process.ex:179-185`. Using the variable's own key
      as the wrapper key makes each `ValidationFailure.field_path` name the
      real variable (`/amount`, not `/value`).
    * **§7.2's `{:error, :unknown_event_type} -> :ok` row is superseded.** "Not
      registered" is now "no row for that `variable_key`", and such a key is
      **omitted** from the map rather than mapped to an outcome; `merge/3`'s
      own `Map.get(validations, key, :ok)` default already covers it.
    * **`req049-variable-merge.md` §13.2's open question is CLOSED, not merely
      re-mapped.** It asked how
      `validate_payload/3`'s `{:error, :tenant_not_provisioned}` and
      `{:error, term()}` cases should map into a `validation_outcome()`.
      `JsonSchema.validate/2` is pure — it performs no `get_type/2` lookup and
      no tenant resolution — so neither error surface exists at all and there
      is nothing left to map.

  A lookup *scoping* failure is a different kind of thing from a rejected
  value and is never folded into "no schemas registered": it returns
  `{:error, {:variable_schema_lookup_failed, reason}}`, which aborts the
  `Ecto.Multi`, writes nothing, and leaves the task `pending` and the instance
  `active`. A missing prefix has no tenant to commit an ERROR tail into, so
  aborting is the only fail-closed answer available.

  ### OPEN QUESTION for REVIEWER — REQ-059's pin vs. this live read

  REQ-059 (PIN-01/PIN-03) freezes exactly one `:variable_schema` pin per
  instance at start and forbids substituting a current version for a pinned
  one, so that "a newer catalog version published mid-flight does not affect
  an in-flight instance." The merge-time read above is **live**, so in
  principle it can expose an in-flight instance to a schema edited after that
  instance started. R-Co does both — the live read at merge
  (`instance.zig:2318`) and a digest pinned at start
  (`pin_resolver.zig:428`/`:490`) — and REQ-109 ports the live read.

  **The conflict is latent, not live**, for three independent reasons:

    1. `pin_resolver.ex:262-263`'s `default_lookup/0` returns
       `{:ok, %{version: "unversioned", json_schema: nil}}` — a populated tuple
       whose `json_schema` is nil — so the one `:variable_schema` pin every
       instance records today carries **no schema content**. Nothing meaningful
       is pinned, so nothing can be contradicted.
    2. REQ-059 AC5's no-fallback guarantee is scoped to
       `Letflow.Engine.PinResolver`, which REQ-109 does not touch.
    3. The conflict activates only once `pin_resolver.ex`'s lookup is wired to
       the real table, which REQ-109 explicitly defers.

  No `docs/migration/decisions/` record is being re-decided — none of the six
  covers variable schemas. If REVIEWER judges this a live conflict with
  REQ-059, it belongs in a decision record, not in this requirement's code.

  ## `cancel_instance/3` (EE-08, REQ-052) — SUPERSESSION and scope boundary

  `lib/letflow/parallel_approval.ex` (`Letflow.ParallelApproval`) and
  `lib/letflow/approval_supervisor.ex` (`Letflow.ApprovalSupervisor`) are
  **deleted** by this requirement, together with REQ-051's `PARALLEL_GATEWAY`
  split/join — the hand-written two-approver `:gen_statem` and its dedicated
  `DynamicSupervisor` are both fully superseded, with no retained/generalized
  half (unlike `Letflow.ProcessInstance`'s own retirement, REQ-046, which kept
  `Letflow.InstanceSupervisor` for a distinct, still-open future need —
  REQ-052 introduces no new process and therefore has no equivalent
  supervisor to keep).

  R-Co's EE-08 additionally (a) cancels pending timers atomically via
  SCH-03 (`src/scheduler/`, S6 — not yet built in Letflow) and (b) abandons
  any in-flight `SERVICE_TASK` HTTP call best-effort (REQ-056's own future
  transport, out of S3 scope). **Neither exists in Letflow yet, and
  `cancel_instance/3` performs neither.** This function cancels what already
  exists today — `tasks`, `tokens`, and `instance_projections` rows, plus the
  one `INSTANCE_CANCELLED` event — and leaves both as named, documented gaps:
  a future S6 timer-scheduling requirement is expected to add its own
  timer-cancellation call alongside this function's own transaction (or a
  follow-up hook this function exposes for it to call), and REQ-056 is
  expected to add its own best-effort HTTP-abort call the same way. Neither
  is a silent omission — `cancel_instance/3` does not claim to fully
  implement EE-08's R-Co scope, only its S3-buildable subset.

  `POST /api/v1/instances/:id/cancel` is S4 (api-surface) scope — this
  function returns tagged tuples only, matching the boundary `create/2`/
  `complete_task/3` already established.

  See `lib/letflow/design/req052-instance-cancellation.md` for the full
  design this section implements.

  ## EE-12 (REQ-055) — lock inventory and cross-instance isolation

  Every `lock("FOR UPDATE")` acquired anywhere in `create/2`, `complete_task/3`,
  and `cancel_instance/3` (this module) plus `Letflow.EventStore.append/2`'s own
  transitive lock is scoped to a single `instance_id`, never wider:

    * `fetch_and_lock_task/3` (`complete_task/3`) — locks `tasks`, filtered
      `where t.id == ^task_id`. **Single-row**: exactly the one `tasks` row
      named by `task_id`, which FK-scopes to exactly one `instance_id`.
    * `fetch_and_lock_instance_projection/3` (`complete_task/3`) — locks
      `instance_projections`, filtered `where p.instance_id == ^instance_id`.
      **Single-row**: exactly this instance's own projection row.
    * `fetch_and_lock_open_tasks/3` (`cancel_instance/3`) — locks `tasks`,
      filtered `where t.instance_id == ^instance_id and t.status == :pending`,
      `order_by asc: t.id`. **Row-set, single-instance**: every row locked
      carries this same `instance_id`; the deterministic `order_by` avoids a
      lock-ordering deadlock against a concurrent multi-row locker on the same
      instance, and never touches another instance's rows.
    * `fetch_and_lock_instance_projection_for_cancel/3` (`cancel_instance/3`) —
      locks `instance_projections`, filtered `where p.instance_id ==
      ^instance_id`. **Single-row**, same shape as the `complete_task/3`
      projection lock above, scoped to this instance only.
    * `fetch_and_lock_live_tokens/3` (`cancel_instance/3`) — locks `tokens`
      (`TokenRecord`), filtered `where t.instance_id == ^instance_id and
      t.status in [:active, :waiting]`, `order_by asc: t.id`. **Row-set,
      single-instance**, same shape as the open-tasks lock above, scoped to
      this instance's own tokens only.
    * `lock_and_increment_sequence/3` (`Letflow.EventStore`, reached from
      every `create/2`/`complete_task/3`/`cancel_instance/3` event append via
      `EventStore.append/2`) — locks `instance_sequences`
      (`InstanceSequence`), filtered `where s.instance_id == ^instance_id`.
      **Single-row, single-instance**: the row is keyed 1:1 by `instance_id`
      (`on_conflict: :nothing, conflict_target: :instance_id` on the
      preceding insert-if-absent step); a concurrent `EventStore.append/2`
      call for a *different* `instance_id` locks a disjoint row and is never
      blocked by this one. `create/2` itself acquires no `lock("FOR UPDATE")`
      of its own — its `Multi.run(:instance_projection, ...)` step only
      inserts fresh rows, so L6 above is its only shared contention point.

  **No global or table-level lock is held anywhere in these write paths.**
  Every lock above is acquired via a `where` clause keyed on `instance_id`
  (directly, or transitively via `task_id`/`token_id` FK-scoped to one
  `instance_id`) — Postgres's `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locks exactly the
  row(s) the query's `WHERE` clause matches, never the table. No
  `Repo.transaction/1` call in `lib/letflow/engine.ex`,
  `lib/letflow/engine/task_activation.ex`, or `lib/letflow/event_store.ex`
  locks any row outside the `instance_id` it was given, and none of those
  three modules holds a `:global`/`Registry`-backed singleton, a
  `Mutex`/`:mutex` dependency, a `LOCK TABLE`, or any
  `GenServer`/`:gen_statem`/`DynamicSupervisor.start_child` call.
  **This finding does not extend to every file under `lib/letflow/engine/*.ex`
  as a blanket claim**: `lib/letflow/engine/plugin_registry.ex`
  (`Letflow.Engine.PluginRegistry`, REQ-057) is `use GenServer` — a real
  singleton process — but it is out of scope here on purpose, not by
  oversight: it holds no `instance_id`-scoped row lock at all (it is a
  registry lookup process, not a `Repo.transaction/1` participant), and it is
  not one of REQ-045/047/048/052's per-instance write paths, which is
  REQ-055's own named scope. `lib/letflow/engine/task_activation.ex` acquires
  no lock of its own anywhere — every step it contributes runs as an
  `Ecto.Multi.run/3` step inside the caller's already-open transaction,
  operating only on rows the caller already locks or fresh rows it is itself
  inserting.

  Lock ordering: `complete_task/3` always locks `tasks` before
  `instance_projections`. `cancel_instance/3` always locks `tasks` before
  `instance_projections` before `tokens`. Both orderings are
  same-instance-scoped (every lock in a given call carries the same
  `instance_id`), so this is a same-instance deadlock-avoidance discipline,
  not a cross-instance one.

  REQ-045 resolved this engine to row-based state (`create/2` is a plain
  function under `Ecto.Multi`, not a supervised `:gen_statem`/
  `DynamicSupervisor`-per-instance process — see this moduledoc's own
  "Process-vs-row decision" section above), so there is no per-instance
  process for a supervised-isolation/process-kill scenario to apply to.
  Isolation instead rests entirely on the row-locking discipline documented
  above, verified under real concurrency by
  `test/letflow/engine_concurrency_test.exs` (REQ-055). See
  `lib/letflow/design/req-055-concurrent-instance-isolation.md` for the full
  design this section implements.

  Completes a `PENDING` `Letflow.Engine.Task` (EE-04): merges
  `attrs[:output_variables]` into the instance's live variables (REQ-049's
  `Letflow.Engine.VariableMerge.merge/3`), evaluates the completed
  `:HUMAN_TASK` node's own outgoing edges via
  `Letflow.Engine.Transition`'s new `{:complete_task, token_id}` dispatch,
  activates any newly-reached `:HUMAN_TASK` node(s)
  (`Letflow.Engine.TaskActivation.append_multi_from_existing_records/6`),
  flips the task row to `COMPLETED`, and appends exactly one
  `TASK_COMPLETED` event (REQ-025) -- all inside one `Ecto.Multi`/
  `Repo.transaction/1`. Row-level `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` locking on the
  `tasks` row (and, for the same reason `instance_projections` writes need
  it, on the owning `instance_projections` row) serializes two concurrent
  `complete_task/3` calls on the same `task_id`: exactly one commits
  `:completed`, the other observes `{:error, {:task_not_pending,
  :completed}}`.

  `attrs[:output_variables]` must be present and a plain map (`%{}` is
  valid); `nil`, a missing key, or a non-map/struct value are all rejected
  with `{:error, :invalid_output_variables}` before any I/O is attempted.
  `attrs[:actor_id]`/`attrs[:idempotency_key]` are not independently
  pre-validated here -- they are plumbed straight through to
  `Letflow.EventStore.append/2`'s own identical requirement, matching
  `create/2`'s own `append_instance_started_event/6` pattern (design doc
  §10).

  Cancels an instance (EE-08): sets every currently `PENDING` `tasks` row and
  every currently `ACTIVE`/`WAITING` `tokens` row of the instance to
  `CANCELLED`, appends exactly one `INSTANCE_CANCELLED` event (REQ-025), and
  sets the `instance_projections` row to `CANCELLED` -- all inside one
  `Ecto.Multi`/`Repo.transaction/1`. Row-level `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`
  locking on the `tasks` row set (locked before `instance_projections`,
  matching `complete_task/3`'s own global lock-ordering rule) serializes a
  `cancel_instance/3` call against a concurrent `complete_task/3` call on the
  same instance: exactly one of the two commits, the other observes a
  distinct, typed conflict error.

  Cancelling an instance whose `instance_projections.status` is already
  `:completed`/`:cancelled` (`Letflow.EventStore.InstanceProjection.terminal?/1`,
  reused unchanged -- the same predicate `Letflow.EventStore.append/2`'s own
  `active_instance_guard/3` already applies) returns
  `{:error, {:instance_already_terminal, status}}` and writes nothing. An
  `:error`-status instance is treated the same as an `:active` one --
  cancellable -- since `terminal?/1` only returns `true` for
  `:completed`/`:cancelled` (design doc §6).

  `attrs[:actor_id]`/`attrs[:idempotency_key]` are pre-validated here, before
  the transaction opens, since this function has no other caller-supplied
  payload to validate (design doc §5, diverging from `complete_task/3`'s own
  "no pre-check, let `append/2` validate" convention).

  See this module's moduledoc for the `Letflow.ParallelApproval`/
  `Letflow.ApprovalSupervisor` SUPERSESSION and the SCH-03/REQ-056 scope
  boundary this function does not implement.

  Hook A of REQ-177 (design doc §2). Called by a future SERVICE_TASK
  dispatch orchestrator (none exists in this codebase yet, per
  `Letflow.Engine.ServiceTask`'s own moduledoc) whenever
  `ServiceTask.decide_failure/3` returns `:give_up` for a SERVICE_TASK node,
  in place of calling `set_instance_error/2` directly.

  Re-derives the exhaustion/non-exhaustion split
  `ServiceTask.decide_failure/3`'s own return value does not carry (design
  doc §3): exactly `ServiceTask.is_retriable_failure(context.last_failure_kind)
  == true and context.attempt_index >= context.retry_limit`. When that is
  **not** the case (an immediately non-retriable failure kind), returns
  `{:error, :not_exhaustion}` and calls neither `Letflow.Dlq.enqueue/2` nor
  `set_instance_error/2` -- the caller is expected to call
  `set_instance_error/2` directly for that case instead, so Hook B
  (`Letflow.Engine.ExecutionError.append_multi/3`'s own
  `:execution_error_dlq_landing` step) lands it generically.

  On genuine exhaustion: lands exactly one `dlq_entries` row via
  `Letflow.Dlq.enqueue/2` (`entry_type: "event"`, `instance_id`,
  `full_reason` naming the classified failure kind, `source_payload` the
  attempted request, `first_failed_at`/`last_failed_at` both the current UTC
  time read at landing, design doc §5.1) **before** delegating to
  `set_instance_error/2` with `dlq_landed_externally: true` so Hook B does
  not also land a row for this same transition (design doc §4).

  **Deferred follow-up (REQ-176's `retry/2`), per the requirement's own
  acceptance criterion:** landing a DLQ entry here does not itself, and
  `Letflow.Dlq.retry/2` called against the entry this function creates does
  not either, re-invoke the original SERVICE_TASK dispatch. Two pieces are
  still missing before it could: (a) a wired SERVICE_TASK transport (the
  injectable `ServiceTask.transport_fun()` -- "no concrete implementation
  ... exists in this codebase yet" per that module's own moduledoc) that a
  future `retry/2`-driven re-dispatch path would need to call, and (b) the
  dispatch orchestrator itself (this function's own caller, which does not
  exist yet) that would need to exist before anything calls `retry/2` in
  response to an operator action at all.
