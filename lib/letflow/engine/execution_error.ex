defmodule Letflow.Engine.ExecutionError do
  @moduledoc """
  EE-10 (REQ-061) — execution error handling. Ports `instance.zig`'s
  `setInstanceError()` (R-Co `instance.zig:3078`, `SetInstanceErrorArgs`
  `instance.zig:289`). Verified directly against R-Co's source (GH#328,
  ISS-0100, 2026-08-20) — field shape matches (§0 of the design doc); the
  `error_type()` union here is deliberately **open**, unlike R-Co's own
  closed 10-variant `ErrorType` enum, because this port collapses R-Co's
  `SUB_PROCESS_*` four variants into one `:subprocess_interface_violation`
  atom pending REQ-062 (design doc §2, §12 OQ-2) — see
  `lib/letflow/design/req061-execution-error-handling.md` §0/§2/§12 OQ-1 for
  the full comparison. This module is **the single, shared path every
  engine-internal failure funnels into** — the one place the
  `instance_projections.status: :error` write, the `EXECUTION_ERROR` event
  append, and the eligibility check are implemented.

  `append_multi/3` matches `Letflow.Engine.TaskActivation`'s own
  `append_multi_from_existing_records/6` composable shape exactly (its own
  INV-EE47-7, copied here as INV-EE61-7): **zero `Repo` calls of its own** —
  every step it appends runs inside the *caller's* already-open
  `Ecto.Multi`/transaction. This module opens no transaction itself.

  ## SCOPE BOUNDARY — OBS-05 dead-letter queue (S6), not built here

  An instance that reaches `ERROR` via this module stays in `ERROR` until an
  **operator** action moves it out — retry (re-attempt the failed step) or
  discard (abandon the instance). That operator action is R-Co's OBS-05
  dead-letter API (`src/dlq/`, S6 operational-cross-cutting, plus S4's own
  route layer to expose it over HTTP) — **neither exists in Letflow yet, and
  this module builds no partial version of either.** No retry-queue table, no
  discard endpoint, no background sweep of `ERROR`-status instances is
  introduced here. The one hook this module leaves for that future work:
  `instance_projections.status == :error` plus its `error_detail` column *is*
  the durable record OBS-05's future dead-letter listing/read path will
  query — no additional table is needed for S6 to find every `ERROR`-halted
  instance once it exists.

  ## DLQ landing, as of REQ-177 (landing only, still not the OBS-05 API above)

  As of REQ-177, `append_multi/3` also lands one `dlq_entries` row per
  `ERROR` transition (its `:execution_error_dlq_landing` step, below) —
  unless the caller already landed one externally via
  `opts[:dlq_landed_externally]` (`Letflow.Engine.land_service_task_exhaustion/2`'s
  own case, REQ-177's Hook A, when it lands a row itself before delegating
  here so this module does not also land a second one for the same
  transition). This does not shrink the scope boundary above — it is
  **landing only**: calling `Letflow.Dlq.retry/2` against that row
  transitions the row's own `status` to `:retrying` and appends to its
  `retry_history` — it does not re-invoke whatever failed, and it does not
  move the instance itself out of `ERROR`. Two things are still missing
  before it could: (a) a wired SERVICE_TASK transport for the subset of
  `ERROR` transitions that originated from a SERVICE_TASK give-up but did
  **not** go through Hook A (the non-exhaustion, immediately-non-retriable
  case, which lands via this module's own step instead — see
  `Letflow.Engine.land_service_task_exhaustion/2`'s own moduledoc for the
  exhaustion case), and (b) an operator-driven `ERROR`-recovery path (the
  still-unbuilt route/controller layer, REQ-178, that would let a human call
  `retry/2`/`discard/2` and separately decide whether/how to actually
  un-stick the instance from `ERROR`) — i.e. the same OBS-05/S4 gap named
  above.

  ## `ERROR` is explicitly NOT terminal, unlike `CANCELLED` and `COMPLETED`

  `Letflow.EventStore.InstanceProjection.terminal?/1` (already shipped,
  REQ-023/043) already encodes this — `true` only for
  `:completed`/`:cancelled`, `false` for both `:active` and `:error` — so
  `Letflow.EventStore.append/2`'s own active-instance guard does **not**
  reject a further append attempt against an `ERROR` instance purely because
  of its status. `Letflow.Engine.complete_task/3`'s own `M2` still rejects
  task completion against an `:error` instance for its own, distinct reason
  (a genuine, typed conflict — `{:error, {:instance_not_active, :error}}`,
  already shipped REQ-048 behavior) — that is that call's own business rule,
  not the event store's terminal-state guard. An operator action (once S6
  lands) can still move an instance out of `ERROR`, which is precisely why
  `ERROR` is a fourth, distinct value in REQ-023's status enum rather than
  folded into `CANCELLED`.

  Appends the EE-10 `ERROR`-transition steps onto `multi` — the shared,
  composable sink every engine-internal failure funnels into
  (`lib/letflow/design/req061-execution-error-handling.md` §3). Steps
  appended, in order:

    * `:execution_error_projection_lock` (only appended when
      `opts[:locked_projection]` is `nil`) — row-locks and fetches
      `instance_projections` by `error_args.instance_id`.
    * `:execution_error_eligibility` — pure check against the locked/passed-in
      projection: `:completed`/`:cancelled` -> `{:error, {:instance_terminal,
      status}}`; already `:error` -> `{:error, {:instance_already_error,
      error_detail}}` (AC5's own conflict shape, the mechanism the row-lock
      queueing establishes); `:active` -> proceeds.
    * `:execution_error_event` — `Letflow.EventStore.append/2`, one
      `EXECUTION_ERROR` event built from `error_args`. Runs **before** the
      projection update, matching `req052`'s own M6-before-M7 ordering
      rationale.
    * `:execution_error_dlq_landing` (REQ-177; skipped entirely when
      `opts[:dlq_landed_externally]` is `true`) — `Letflow.Dlq.enqueue/2`,
      one `dlq_entries` row built from `error_args` and the just-persisted
      `:execution_error_event` step's own event payload. Runs **after** the
      event (so its `full_reason` can be read back from the persisted
      event's own `payload["reason"]`, not re-derived from `error_args`) and
      **before** the projection update, so a DLQ-enqueue failure also
      prevents the projection from ever flipping to `:error` — see
      `lib/letflow/design/req177-dlq-hooks.md` §4.2.
    * `:execution_error_projection_update` — `InstanceProjection.update_changeset/2`
      (reused unchanged) with `%{status: :error, error_detail: <compact
      detail map>}`.

  `opts[:locked_projection]`: when the caller already holds a `SELECT ... FOR
  UPDATE` lock on this instance's `instance_projections` row within the
  *same* transaction, pass the already-fetched struct here to avoid a second,
  redundant lock/fetch. When absent (the default), this function performs its
  own lock+fetch as its first appended step.

  `opts[:dlq_landed_externally]` (REQ-177, defaults to `false`): set by a
  caller (`Letflow.Engine.land_service_task_exhaustion/2`) that already
  landed a `dlq_entries` row itself before calling into this function, so
  this function's own `:execution_error_dlq_landing` step is skipped rather
  than landing a second row for the same transition.

  Every write happens inside the *caller's* already-open `Ecto.Multi` — this
  function calls `Repo.transaction/1` nowhere in its own body (INV-EE61-7).
