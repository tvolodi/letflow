defmodule Letflow.Engine.Lua.Platform do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-152 (LUA-14 restated) — implements the `platform.now()` half of LUA-14 ("Time
  Source, MUST"): `platform.now()` MUST return the platform's authoritative time as ISO
  8601 UTC. The other half of LUA-14 (denying `os.time` and its ambient-time siblings) is
  implemented in `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Sandbox`'s deny-set, not here — see that module's
  moduledoc for the restatement of why `os.date`/`os.clock`/`os.difftime`/`os.setlocale`
  are also denied, beyond LUA-14's literal wording.

  This module owns two concerns, deliberately kept together rather than split across
  files: what `platform.now()` returns (`now/0`), and how the entire `platform.*` table
  becomes reachable from a Lua script at all (`install/1`, `install/2`).

  ## `platform.now` is ungated by design — not an omission

  Per decision 0014 / R-Co's `src/lua/host_api/mod.zig` capability matrix: `now` is "a
  pure time read with no state reach," and that matrix entry is "a POSITIVE design
  statement, not an omission ... A test that expects a gate on `now` or `fail` is reading
  the matrix wrong."

  **Binding statement for future requirements:** `platform.now/0` has no capability
  check, no gate, no permission lookup, anywhere in its call path — by design,
  permanently, not "not yet implemented." `install/1`/`install/2` wire it unconditionally
  into every `Lua.t()` that `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Sandbox.new/0` or `new/1` produces; there
  is no `Sandbox.new/1` option that can suppress or gate it, and none should ever be
  added. REQ-157's capability-gating work (below) MUST NOT add a gate to `platform.now`
  "by symmetry" with the gating mechanism it introduces for the other six `platform.*`
  functions.

  ## Time-source injection — behaviour + application-env resolution

  `now/0` never reads `DateTime.utc_now/0` directly. It resolves the configured
  `#{inspect(__MODULE__)}.TimeSource` implementation from application env
  (`Application.get_env(:letflow, :lua_platform_time_source, ...)`), read fresh on every
  call (never cached), and calls that implementation's `now/0` callback. This lets a test
  swap in a fixed-value double via `Application.put_env/3` in `setup`/`on_exit`, without
  recompiling or restarting any supervision tree, and asserts `platform.now()` returns
  one exact, pre-set timestamp rather than merely a well-formed one. The default
  implementation, `#{inspect(__MODULE__)}.SystemClock`, is the one and only production
  call site of `DateTime.utc_now/0` this requirement's module set introduces.

  ## Composition point

  `install/1` is called from `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Sandbox.new/1`'s construction pipeline,
  immediately after the sandboxed VM is constructed — every `Lua.t()` produced by
  `Sandbox.new/0` or `Sandbox.new/1` therefore has the full `platform.*` table available
  with no second call any caller must remember to make. `install/1`/`install/2` never
  touch the deny-set: installing globals at `[:platform, _]` and denying paths under
  `[:os, ...]` are independent operations.

  ## REQ-157 (LUA-05, LUA-06 restated) — the capability matrix

  This requirement extends `platform` from the single `now` function (REQ-152) to the
  full, CLOSED set of exactly 8 functions this module's own `@capability_matrix`
  below names — the closed set of what `platform.*` exposes, and nothing else. Every
  `platform.*` global this module ever installs comes from `@capability_matrix` below,
  via a single fold in `install/2` — there is no other place in this module, or anywhere
  else under `lib/`, that installs a `platform.*` global via `Lua.set!/3` (INV-CAP-1).
  Adding a 9th `platform.*` function means adding a 9th row to this matrix; there is no
  other way to expose one.

  | Function | Required capability | Notes |
  |---|---|---|
  | `call_service` | `"service:call:" <> svc_id` (the first call argument, via `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Capabilities.service_capability/1`) | Parameterised — a grant for one service does not authorise another. |
  | `read_variable` | `"variable:read"` | Constant, ignores arguments. |
  | `write_variable` | `"variable:write"` | Constant, ignores arguments. |
  | `log` | `"audit:log"` | Constant, ignores arguments. |
  | `emit_event` | `"event:emit"` | Constant, ignores arguments. |
  | `get_instance_state` | `"instance:read"` | Constant, ignores arguments. |
  | `now` | `:none` — no capability, ever | Ungated by design (see above). A pure time read with no state reach (LUA-14). |
  | `fail` | `:none` — no capability, ever | Ungated by design. A script may always terminate itself: gating self-termination behind a capability would mean a script could be denied the ability to stop itself, which serves no isolation purpose (it does not reach any state, service, or variable) and would only complicate the one guaranteed way a script has of signaling its own failure back to the host. |

  **A test that expects a gate on `now` or `fail` is reading the matrix wrong** — neither
  function's `required` value is ever a capability string, in any row, for any argument;
  both always evaluate to `:none`, which `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Capabilities.check/3` treats
  as an unconditional `:ok` without ever consulting the calling script's grant set
  (INV-CAP-4).

  At the time REQ-157 shipped, every one of the six gated functions was stubbed only
  enough to prove the gate ran (`Letflow.Engine.Lua.Capabilities.check!/3` raises a
  `Lua.RuntimeException` on denial, LUA-06's "MUST raise a Lua error") — none of the six
  had a real implementation yet. REQ-159 and REQ-160 (below) have since replaced all six
  stubs with real implementations. `install/1` remains a thin delegate to `install/2`
  with an empty `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Capabilities.new()` grant set, so every production
  `Sandbox.new/0,1` VM exposes all 8 names with the six gated ones permanently denying
  until a future requirement calls `install/2` directly with a populated grant set.

  ## REQ-159 (LUA-11 read half, LUA-13) — `read_variable`, `get_instance_state`, `log`

  Implements `lib/letflow/design/req159-lua-host-api-read.md`. Three of the six gated
  stubs above become real: `read_variable` (a plain lookup on an already-resolved
  variables map, no `Letflow.Repo` call), `get_instance_state` (the one function in this
  set that reads `Letflow.Repo`, and only ever the calling script's own instance — see
  below), and `log` (emits via `Logger.log/3`, tagged with host-authored correlation
  fields only). `write_variable`, `call_service`, `emit_event` were `:not_yet_implemented`
  at the time this section was written; see the REQ-160 section below for their real
  implementations. `now`/`fail` are untouched by either requirement.

  A new `execution_context` value (`instance_id`, `prefix`, `trace_id`, `script_identity`,
  `variables`) is captured once per `install/3` call, the same closure-capture mechanism
  `capabilities` already uses — never passed as a Lua-visible argument, never read from a
  Lua global. `install/1`/`install/2` stay source-compatible, delegating down to
  `install/3` with `empty_execution_context/0` (design §2.3.1) — every production
  `Sandbox.new/0,1` VM still exposes all 8 names, but the three real functions observe an
  empty context (no variables, no prefix, no trace id) until a future requirement wires a
  real one through `Sandbox.new/1`'s or `Executor`'s call path (design OQ-1, explicitly
  deferred, not this requirement's `owned_modules`).

  **`get_instance_state` is scoped to the calling script's own instance, always** (design
  §5.1, a load-bearing default-scope decision from this design's own rework iteration 1).
  The script-supplied `instance_id` argument is accepted ONLY when it equals
  `execution_context.instance_id`; any other value — a real same-tenant sibling instance
  or a nonexistent id, indistinguishable from each other in the response — is rejected as
  `"forbidden"` with **no `Letflow.Repo` call attempted at all**. Only a match reaches
  `Repo.get/3`, and only ever with `execution_context.prefix` (decision 0014 (e): the
  tenant prefix comes from the calling engine code, never from script-supplied input, on
  every one of this requirement's `Repo` call sites — there is exactly one).

  ## Deviation from the design's literal `run_stub/4` — flagged for REVIEWER

  Design §7.3 specifies `run_stub/3` widening to `run_stub/4` (`stub_spec()`, `atom()`,
  `[term()]`, `execution_context()`) with "no other structural change to the
  `Enum.reduce/3` shape" (§7.4) — implying the installed wrapper stays the single-argument
  `fn args -> ... end` shape already at this file's `install/2`. That literal shape cannot
  actually implement `get_instance_state`'s success case: `tv-labs/lua` requires every
  dynamically-built Lua table to be produced via `Lua.encode!/2` against the *current
  call's* `Lua.t()`/state (confirmed directly against `deps/lua/lib/lua.ex` — a bare
  Elixir map returned from a `Lua.set!/3` callback fails `Util.encoded?/1` and raises
  "maps must be explicitly encoded to tables using `Lua.encode!/2`"), and a
  single-argument callback has no access to that state at all. `Lua.set!/3` itself
  documents a second, `arity/2` callback form (`fn args, lua -> ... end`) precisely for
  this case, so `install/3`'s fold uses that documented arity-2 form instead, and
  `run_stub/3` becomes `run_stub/5` (the same three prior arguments, plus
  `execution_context()` per the design, plus the call's own `Lua.t()`) rather than
  `run_stub/4`. This is the same category of "design text doesn't compile/run against the
  real dependency" gap already on record for this codebase (see
  `Letflow.EventStore.InstanceProjection`'s `JSONArray`/`unique_constraint` deviations) —
  not a shortcut: every other structural property the design actually cares about (one
  fold, one `Lua.set!/3` call site per row, `capabilities` and `execution_context` both
  closed over once, the six unaffected rows unedited beyond ignoring the extra argument)
  is preserved exactly.

  A related, smaller correction to design §6.1 step 1: a Lua-table argument (e.g.
  `log`'s `context`) does **not** arrive at a `Lua.set!/3` callback already decoded into
  a plain Elixir term "by `tv-labs/lua`'s own argument-marshalling at the call boundary"
  — confirmed directly against `deps/lua/lib/lua/vm/value.ex`'s `decode/3`, which only
  runs when something explicitly calls `Lua.decode!/2`/`decode_list!/2`; an un-decoded
  table argument is still its internal `{:tref, id}` reference. `do_log/3` below calls
  `Lua.decode!/2` on `context` explicitly for this reason, rather than passing the raw
  reference through to `Logger.log/3`'s metadata (which would leak a VM-internal,
  process-local id into a log entry — never useful to a reader and not safely
  serializable).

  ## REQ-160 (LUA-11 write half, LUA-12) — `write_variable`, `call_service`, `emit_event`

  Implements `lib/letflow/design/req160-lua-host-api-write.md`. The three remaining
  `:not_yet_implemented` stubs become real. **None of the three ever raises** except via
  the fold-level `Capabilities.check!/3` gate, structurally prior to any of them
  running.

  `write_variable(name, value)` stages the write into a **process-dictionary** buffer
  private to the one BEAM process executing the current script (design §2.2/2.3) — never
  into `Lua.t()`'s own state. Because REQ-155's wall-clock kill and REQ-156's memory-limit
  kill both terminate that same process, and the only two channels a caller ever observes
  a kill through are a payload-less `:DOWN` message or (on the two timeout-specific arms)
  a structured error tuple those two designs' own code returns *unconditionally*
  regardless of what a killed process's own reply might contain
  (`INV-write-discard-on-race`, design §2.2), a staged write is discarded automatically
  by any kill or raised script error, with no special discard mechanism needed here. The
  new public `take_staged_writes/0` reads and clears that buffer; this module never calls
  it itself — some future, out-of-scope caller (design §2.5 OQ-1, `executor.ex`, not in
  this requirement's `owned_modules`) is the first real caller. Makes no `Letflow.Repo`
  call; never raises.

  `call_service(service_id, payload)` resolves an injected `#{inspect(__MODULE__)}.ServiceCaller`
  implementation from application env (`Application.get_env(:letflow,
  :lua_platform_service_caller, ...)`, read fresh on every call — mirrors `TimeSource`'s
  own resolution exactly), defaulting to `#{inspect(__MODULE__)}.NoServiceCaller`, which
  always returns `{:error, :service_caller_not_configured}`. A service-call **failure**
  returns a structured `[nil, error_table]` Lua result; it never raises. This is
  genuinely distinct from a **missing** `service:call:<id>` capability, which raises at
  the fold level, one step before `call_service`'s own body is ever entered — a denied
  call never reaches this function's body, and this function's body never raises (design
  §4.3). Makes no `Letflow.Repo` call.

  `emit_event(event_type, payload, idempotency_key)` hooks into the real, already-shipped
  `Letflow.EventStore.append/2` (`lib/letflow/event_store.ex`). Its `prefix:` option is
  **always** `execution_context.prefix` — never anything derived from `event_type`,
  `payload`, or `idempotency_key`, the three script-supplied arguments (decision 0014
  (e)). This is the one function this requirement adds that calls `Letflow.Repo` at all
  (transitively, via `append/2`). Any `{:error, reason}` from `append/2` becomes a
  structured `[nil, error_table]` Lua result, never a raise; the only raise on this
  function's entire call path is the fold-level `event:emit` capability gate.
  `execution_context` gains one new field for this, `actor_id` — host-authored only,
  exactly like `trace_id`/`script_identity` (REQ-159 §2.3), never taken from a script
  argument.

  Every numeric value any of these three functions moves across the Elixir/Lua boundary
  goes through `Letflow.Engine.LuaNumberMarshalling.from_lua/1` (write direction) or
  `to_lua/1` (read direction) exclusively — no second, ad hoc numeric-conversion rule is
  introduced anywhere in this section (REQ-150 §2.1/§2.2).

  ## REQ-161 (LUA-15 restated) — `platform.fail` terminates by a mechanism the script cannot intercept

  Implements `lib/letflow/design/req161-lua-platform-fail.md`. LUA-15 reads: "a script may
  call `platform.fail(reason, details)` to deliberately abort its own execution; this MUST
  terminate the script's execution in a way that cannot depend on the script declining to
  catch the error." Decision 0014's LUA-15 watchlist entry names the concrete hazard this
  restatement exists to close: an ordinary Elixir `raise` from inside a host function is
  exactly the shape a Lua `pcall` wrapper can catch, letting the script's own execution
  continue past the point it was supposed to have terminated at.

  **The prior `:fail` stub was that exact hazard, not a placeholder.** It built a message
  and called `raise Lua.RuntimeException, ...` — an ordinary `Exception` struct raised via
  `raise/2`. REQ-148's spike §4 (OQ-2 (b)) proved directly against the real, vendored
  `tv-labs/lua` runtime that a host function's `raise` IS caught by the calling script's own
  `pcall`, and the script's execution continues past the `pcall` block — i.e. a script could
  wrap `platform.fail(...)` in `pcall` and keep running exactly as decision 0014 warns
  against, and nothing in the old stub stopped it.

  **The actual mechanism**: `do_fail/2` calls `exit({:script_failed, %{reason: reason,
  details: details}})` from inside the `platform.fail` native function itself, terminating
  the calling process outright. This is uninterceptable because `tv-labs/lua`'s entire
  `pcall`/`xpcall`/native-call boundary is implemented via Elixir `try/rescue` —
  `deps/lua/lib/lua.ex`'s `do_call_function/3` (the `{:native_func, fun}` call clause) and
  `deps/lua/lib/lua/vm/stdlib.ex`'s `lua_pcall/2`/`lua_xpcall/2` are each `rescue`-only, with
  no `catch` clause of any kind on the call chain a `platform.*` function can reach — and
  `rescue` has no clause pattern that ever matches an `exit/1` call. An unhandled `exit/1`
  ends the calling process immediately; there is no "resume after exit," so a `pcall`
  wrapper cannot "continue past" a call that ends the very process trying to continue.
  (Full trace: this design's §2.2.)

  **LUA-15's engine-side half has no real call site today.** LUA-15 also names two
  engine-side obligations beyond producing the structured failure: recording a SCRIPT_FAILED
  event, and transitioning the instance per the node's error policy. Neither
  `lib/letflow/engine/plugin_interface.ex` (its own moduledoc: no `resolve_*`/`invoke/2,3`
  wiring into the engine's node-dispatch path exists yet) nor
  `lib/letflow/engine/lua_script_audit.ex` (its own moduledoc: "nothing in this codebase
  calls `execute_script_for_audit/6`") has a caller that could consume a script's outcome and
  act on it. `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Executor.execute_with_manifest/2,3` is the closest existing
  caller of `Lua.eval!/2`, and it itself has no caller yet either. This requirement produces
  the structured SCRIPT_FAILED outcome only — it does not, and cannot yet, wire the
  event-recording/error-policy-transition half.

  **SCRIPT_FAILED and a future SCRIPT_ERROR (REQ-162) do not collapse into the same shape.**
  `{:script_failed, %{reason: String.t(), details: term()}}` is produced only by a
  deliberate `platform.fail` call, observed as a process exit reason (a `:DOWN` message, or
  `Task.yield/2`'s `{:exit, reason}` clause) — the evaluating process is dead. A future
  SCRIPT_ERROR (an uncaught Lua runtime error propagating out of `Lua.eval!/2` as a
  `Lua.RuntimeException` or similar, per REQ-153/154/155's existing `rescue` clauses in
  `executor.ex`) is a normal function return/raise, not an `exit/1`, and necessarily carries
  different fields. `:script_failed` is reserved to mean "deliberate `platform.fail` call,"
  specifically so REQ-162 must not reuse this tag.

  **Honest gap: this distinction does not survive `Executor.execute_with_manifest/2,3`
  today.** Read directly, not assumed: `executor.ex`'s `handle_yield_result/3` clause for
  `{:exit, reason}`, and its raw-heap-limit `:DOWN` handling, both collapse every non-`:killed`
  exit reason — including a deliberate `{:script_failed, _}` one — into an opaque,
  `inspect/1`-rendered string via `format_exit_reason/1`, indistinguishable in shape from any
  other task crash. `executor.ex` is not in this requirement's `owned_modules` and is not
  edited to special-case `{:script_failed, _}` ahead of that stringification. This
  requirement's own tests therefore assert the SCRIPT_FAILED distinction at the raw
  process/monitor boundary (a `Task.async`/`Task.yield` or `Process.monitor` observation of
  `Lua.eval!/2` running directly against `Platform.install/3`'s output) — not through
  `Executor.execute_with_manifest/2,3`, whose own `{:error, String.t()}` return shape does
  not preserve it.

  The single registration point for the entire `platform.*` table (INV-CAP-1). Folds over
  `@capability_matrix`, calling `Lua.set!/3` once per row to bind `[:platform, row.name]`
  to a Lua-callable wrapper. `capabilities` **and** `execution_context` are each captured
  once per `install/3` call and closed over by every one of the 8 installed wrappers --
  both are fixed for the lifetime of the returned `Lua.t()`. See moduledoc "Deviation from
  the design's literal `run_stub/4`" for why the installed wrapper is the documented
  `fn args, lua -> ... end` (arity-2) form rather than the arity-1 form `install/2`
  previously used, and why that change is necessary rather than cosmetic.

  Each installed wrapper, when invoked with the Lua call's argument list:

    1. computes the capability this particular call requires by applying `row.required`
       to the argument list (a constant string for 6 of the 8 rows, parameterised by the
       first argument for `call_service`, or `:none` for `now`/`fail`);
    2. passes that value, `capabilities`, and `row.name` to
       `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Capabilities.check!/3` — the single gate call every wrapper
       makes; on denial it raises and the wrapper never proceeds to step 3;
    3. only if `check!/3` returns, invokes `row.stub` with the same argument list, the
       closed-over `execution_context`, and the call's own `Lua.t()`, returning its result
       as the Lua call's return value (and, for `read_variable`/`get_instance_state`, a
