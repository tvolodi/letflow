defmodule Letflow.Engine.Lua.Sandbox do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-151 (LUA-03, LUA-04 restated) — the single sandbox-construction entry point for
  tenant-supplied Lua script execution. Implements
  `lib/letflow/design/req151-lua-sandbox.md` exactly.

  `Sandbox.new/0` and `Sandbox.new/1` are the ONLY permitted call sites of `Lua.new/1`
  anywhere under `lib/` (INV-SBX-1). Every `Lua.t()` value reachable anywhere in this
  codebase that will run tenant-supplied script text MUST have been produced here, and by
  nothing else. This is enforced structurally (single call site), not by a runtime check.

  ## REQ-152 (LUA-14 restated) — additions to this module

  This file also implements the deny-set half of REQ-152 (LUA-14 restated; the
  `platform.now()` half lives in `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Platform`). Of Lua 5.3's 11 `os`
  functions, `Lua.new/1`'s own documented default sandbox denies only 6 — `os.execute`,
  `os.exit`, `os.getenv`, `os.remove`, `os.rename`, `os.tmpname`. It does NOT deny
  `os.clock`, `os.date`, `os.difftime`, `os.setlocale`, or `os.time` — 5 of the 11 are
  left reachable by the library's own defaults. REQ-152 closes all 5: `os.time` is
  LUA-14's own literal, sole-named acceptance criterion; denying `os.date`, `os.clock`,
  and `os.difftime` goes BEYOND LUA-14's literal wording, as a deliberate extension of
  its intent (time is read only from `platform.now()`'s single authoritative source,
  never an ambient one). `os.setlocale` is not a time source, but was left reachable by
  this module's original (REQ-151) deny-set despite REQ-151's own description text
  claiming it fell to "REQ-151's general enumeration" — that claim did not match the
  actual implemented list, so REQ-152 closes this gap here rather than silently leaving
  it, or reopening REQ-151. The deny-set below grew from 28 to 33 entries as a result,
  appended to the same list passed to `Lua.new/1`'s `sandboxed:` option — never a second
  or partial list (see "The `:sandboxed`-replaces-defaults trap" below, which this
  extension is equally subject to).

  Construction never fails: there is no `{:ok, _} | {:error, _}` return shape for `new/0`
  or `new/1` (INV-SBX-4) — there is no external I/O, no config lookup, and no user input
  at construction time.

  ## LUA-03 restatement (design §7)

  This module restates R-Co's LUA-03 rather than satisfying its literal text, for three
  reasons:

  (a) `loadstring` is a Lua 5.1 name absent from Lua 5.3. The runtime this sandbox wraps
  (`tv-labs/lua`) implements Lua 5.3 only; there is no `loadstring` global to remove
  because Lua 5.3 never had one (renamed/merged into `load` upstream). Restated as a
  deny-set entry anyway, for literal-text completeness, though it denies nothing that
  could otherwise be reached.

  (b) `jit`, `ffi`, and `bit` do not exist in Lua 5.3 at all — they are LuaJIT-specific.
  R-Co's exclusion of them, including `ffi` (which R-Co's `stdlib.zig` calls "a
  COMPLETE sandbox escape"), is vacuous under this runtime, not satisfied. No deny-set
  entry is added for them because there is nothing at those paths to deny and no library
  file installs them.

  (c) R-Co's SBX-1 invariant ("prune strictly AFTER open") does not transfer as a
  mechanism. `Lua.new/1` sandboxes by construction — the deny-set is applied while
  building the VM state, not by opening a full stdlib and pruning it afterward — so there
  is no open-then-prune ordering for this module to get right or wrong. The property
  SBX-1 protects (no window during which a denied global is reachable) still holds:
  every caller only ever observes a `Lua.t()` already returned by `Sandbox.new/0` or
  `Sandbox.new/1`; no intermediate construction state is ever exposed by this module's
  public API.

  `debug` is additional, not a fourth restatement reason — it is a gap in what the
  library's own default denies, not a gap in what LUA-03's text could name (R-Co's
  LUA-03 does name `debug` as MUST-NOT-load; this module actually satisfies that part of
  LUA-03's literal text where the library's un-amended default does not — see the
  deny-set below).

  ## LUA-04 restatement (design §8)

  This module restates R-Co's LUA-04 ("the sandbox MUST refuse to load Lua bytecode;
  only source text MAY be loaded") rather than satisfying it literally. The adopted
  runtime (`tv-labs/lua`) parses Lua source text only — it has no bytecode format, no
  bytecode loader, and therefore no bytecode-rejection code path to test. LUA-04 holds
  structurally: only source text can ever be loaded because nothing else is
  representable, not because a rejection check runs and returns an error. What this
  module's test suite verifies instead is the absence of every loader capable of
  consuming either form: `load`, `loadfile`, `dofile`, and `string.dump` — the last of
  which is doubly structural, since without a bytecode format there is also nothing for
  `string.dump` to serialize a function *into*, and indeed no such function is installed
  at all in this runtime.

  ## `coroutine` decision (design §6)

  `coroutine` does not exist in this Lua runtime at all — confirmed by reading
  `deps/lua/lib/lua/vm/stdlib.ex`'s installed library list and finding zero references
  to `"coroutine"` anywhere under `deps/lua/lib/`.

  No deny-set entry is added for `[:coroutine]`. Reason: `Lua.sandbox/2` works by
  overwriting a path with a raising function — calling it on a path that does not
  currently exist would CREATE a new global named `coroutine` (a callable that raises),
  where none exists today. That is the opposite of the intended effect: it manufactures
  a global surface rather than removing one, and a future reader diffing `pairs(_G)`
  against this module's deny-set could be misled into thinking `coroutine` is a real,
  sandboxed table rather than nothing at all. What is tested instead is that
  `coroutine == nil` from inside a `Sandbox.new/0` VM, proving the absence directly.

  If a future `tv-labs/lua` upgrade adds a `coroutine` library, the "coroutine is nil"
  test will start FAILING (not silently pass) — that failure is the intended trigger for
  revisiting this decision, and should be read as "the runtime changed a starting
  assumption," not as flakiness.

  ## No custom deny-set list (design §5 AC3 disposition)

  `new/1`'s `opts` do not expose a way for a caller to add or remove individual denied
  paths — the 28-entry deny-set below is fixed by this module. REQ-152 (LUA-14) is the
  requirement that extends this deny-set (the `os` time-surface functions); it consumes
  this module rather than constructing its own `Lua.t()`.

  ## The `:sandboxed`-replaces-defaults trap (design §5)

  `Lua.new/1`'s `sandboxed:` option is NOT merged with the library's own
  `@default_sandbox` — whatever list is passed IS the complete sandboxed set for that VM
  instance. Passing a partial list (e.g. calling the library directly with only
  `sandboxed: [[:os, :time]]`) would deny `os.time` and nothing else, silently reopening
  every other default denial. This module
  avoids that trap by never passing a partial list: the deny-set below restates every one
  of the library's 27 default paths explicitly in source (not by reference to
  `@default_sandbox`, so a future edit to the library's own default cannot silently
  change this module's behavior underneath it), plus this module's own addition
  (`[:debug]`), for a fixed 28-entry list every time.
