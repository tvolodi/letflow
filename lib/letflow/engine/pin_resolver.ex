  PIN-01..PIN-04 (REQ-059) — dependency pin resolution, recording, and
  inheritance. Ports `src/engine/pin_resolver.zig` (R-Co, 967 lines).

  **Sourcing.** At design and implementation time no read of
  `pin_resolver.zig` was made, and every behavioural claim here traced to
  REQ-059's own requirement text or to already-shipped Letflow code, cited by
  file/line. R-Co has since been read directly (REQ-110 audit, 2026-08-19),
  and that reconstruction did **not** hold on the override path: see the
  OQ-1 resolution below, `docs/issues/ISS-0079.yaml` (GH#298) and
  `docs/issues/ISS-0078.yaml` (GH#299). Treat any claim in this moduledoc
  that REQ-110 did not explicitly verify as still unconfirmed against R-Co.
  See `lib/letflow/design/req059-pin-resolver.md`
  (the gate-approved design this module implements) for the full algorithm,
  error taxonomy, and open questions this moduledoc restates the load-bearing
  parts of.

  This module is the mechanism that freezes every versioned dependency an
  instance uses at start time (`resolve/4`), records that frozen set as part
  of the `INSTANCE_STARTED` event payload (`Letflow.Engine.create/2`, not
  this module — see "Persistence" below), and lets replay
  (`Letflow.Engine.Reconstruction`, REQ-053) and child-instance inheritance
  derive the *effective* pin set purely from already-appended events, never
  from a live catalog read.

  ## SCOPE GAP — service_catalog (S6) and PLC-01 (unscoped) are not built

  PIN-01 AC1 (`service_catalog` version resolution) and PIN-01 AC2
  (`module_ref` resolution against PLC-01) are **not satisfiable in Letflow
  today**: this module resolves `catalog_entry` and `module` references only
  against an **injectable** `Lookup` (see `Lookup` below), never a real
  catalog/registry — `src/repository/service_catalog.zig` is **stage S6**
  (operational cross-cutting / repository layer), not yet ported; PLC-01 (the
  process module catalog) is **unscoped to any stage** and does not exist in
  this codebase at all. PIN-03 AC3 (execution proceeds on a pinned version
  after that version is DEPRECATED) is likewise unsatisfiable — there is no
  version/status column on anything in Letflow's catalog-shaped state to
  become DEPRECATED in the first place, the same underlying absence. R-Co
  itself holds PIN-01 and PIN-03 at TESTED rather than RELEASED over this
  identical absence, tracked there as **ISS-0672/GH-306**.

  This module implements the resolution/ordering/recording/inheritance
  MACHINERY against an injectable catalog and module lookup — the same
  pattern `Letflow.Definitions.ServiceScopeValidator` used for its identical
  missing-catalog gap. An unresolvable reference returns a distinct
  `{:unresolved_catalog_ref, ref}` / `{:unresolved_module_ref, ref}` error
  (see `resolve/4`), never a silent no-op or a stub that pretends to
  resolve.

  ## `(node_type, attribute_key)` convention — reused, not invented here

  The two `(node_type, attribute_key)` pairs `resolve/4` walks —
  `("SERVICE_TASK", "service_id")` for `kind: :catalog_entry` and
  `("SUB_PROCESS", "module_ref")` for `kind: :module` — are the same pairing
  `Letflow.Definitions.PromotionPlan.build_entries/6` already uses for its
  own `:service_binding`/`:module_ref` promotion dimensions
  (`lib/letflow/definitions/promotion_plan.ex:234-244`) — this is the only
  other place in the shipped codebase naming which attribute key on which
  node type constitutes a catalog/module reference, and this module reuses
  that pairing verbatim rather than guessing fresh.

  ## Persistence — the event log is the only record (PIN-02 AC3)

  No migration, no `Ecto.Schema`, no DB table is added by this requirement
  anywhere. Every pin fact this module produces is a plain map embedded by
  `Letflow.Engine.create/2` into the `INSTANCE_STARTED` event's payload — see
  that module's `start_instance/5` for the exact call-order this module
  integrates into (pin resolution, then variable validation, then
  inheritance, all *before* `create_snapshot/3`'s first `Repo` write, so a
  failed resolution writes zero rows — PIN-01 AC1/AC4, PIN-02 AC2).

  ## Two different "effective pin set" functions (do not conflate)

  REQ-059's own prose uses "effective pin set" for two distinct
  computations, and this module keeps them as two distinct functions:

    * `merge_effective_pins/3` (plus its caller `reconstruct_effective_pins/2`)
      is the **replay-time** computation — `INSTANCE_STARTED`'s base pin set
      folded with zero or more `INSTANCE_PINS_REBOUND` deltas, pure, no I/O.
    * `apply_inheritance/2` is the **instance-start-time child-inheritance**
      computation — an entirely different job, run once per child instance
      start, not a replay-time fold.

  ## No fallback, ever (PIN-03 AC1/AC5)

  No function anywhere in this module — not `resolve/4`, not
  `merge_effective_pins/3`, not `apply_inheritance/2`, not `pin_for/3` —
  ever queries a catalog/module/variable-schema lookup for a "current" or
  "latest" value as a substitute when a pin is absent. `{:error,
  {:pin_missing, kind, ref}}` (`pin_for/3`) is the only outcome for "no pin
  entry," always.

  ## PIN-03 AC4 — exhausted retry budget, named hook only (no DLQ here)

  R-Co's PIN-03 AC4 routes an exhausted `PinMissing` retry budget to the dead
  letter queue. `OBS-05`'s DLQ is stage S6 (operational cross-cutting), not
  yet ported — REQ-056 flagged this identical gap for its own service-task
  dispatch retries, and this module inherits the same absence rather than
  re-deciding it independently. **No retry loop, no retry budget, and no DLQ
  write of any kind exists in this module** — `pin_for/3` is a single,
  synchronous lookup with no notion of "retry." This module reserves the
  **event type name `PIN_RETRY_EXHAUSTED`** (not emitted by any code in this
  requirement's own scope, and not registered in `Letflow.EventStore.Registry`
  by this requirement) as the documented attachment point a future stage-S6
  DLQ integration hooks onto, once `OBS-05` lands.

  ## Open questions carried from the design doc (not silently resolved)

  See `lib/letflow/design/req059-pin-resolver.md` §9 for the full list
  (OQ-1..OQ-6: what produces `source: :override`; "most recent" vs. "all"
  `INSTANCE_PINS_REBOUND` events; `attrs` vs. `opts` placement; the
  `:parent_instance_id` key name guess against not-yet-built REQ-062;
  `variable_schema_lookup` totality; override vs. inheritance precedence).

  **OQ-1 is RESOLVED as of 2026-08-19** (REQ-110 audit, run
  `WF03-REQ110-20260819`) and no longer open. R-Co's `pin_resolver.zig` was
  read directly and its `source: :override` mechanism **differed materially**
  from the §4.1 design this module implements. R-Co applies overrides as an
  overlay AFTER full resolution and verifies each one against the catalog,
  rejecting any override whose `version` is not the currently-resolvable
  version with `UnresolvedPinOverride` / HTTP 422
  (`pin_resolver.zig:296-299`, `:602-691`, `:189-190`); it rejects
  `kind: module` overrides outright (`:642`, an artefact of PLC-01 not
  existing in R-Co, not a principled rule) and treats an override naming an
  unreferenced ref as an error rather than a no-op (`:707-723`). R-Co
  additionally sets `source: :override` from a SECOND producer this module's
  design never anticipated: a PIN-05 rebind (`pin_resolver.zig:138`, `:156`,
  tested at `:914`).

  **Both deltas this OQ-1 resolution surfaced are now fixed, not merely
  recorded.** The override-verification delta — this module, at the time of
  the REQ-110 audit, took a caller-supplied override verbatim with no lookup
  call, no verification, and no `unresolved_pin_override` error variant — is
  fixed under `docs/issues/ISS-0079.yaml` (GH#298,
  `lib/letflow/design/iss-0079-pin-override-verification.md`): every override
  is now verified against `Lookup` before being trusted (Decision 1), a
  stray/mismatched override is `{:error, {:unresolved_pin_override, ref}}`
  (Decisions 2/4), and `kind: module` is verified the same way as
  `catalog_entry` rather than special-cased to always fail (Decision 3 —
  Letflow's `Lookup.module_lookup` is a real injectable field, unlike R-Co's
  structural inability to ever resolve one). The rebind-provenance delta was
  fixed under `docs/issues/ISS-0078.yaml` (GH#299,
  `lib/letflow/design/iss-0078-pin-rebind-provenance.md`) — `source: :rebound`
  (a distinct value from R-Co's `:override`, not a copy of it), a rebound
  entry's `resolved_id` becomes `nil` (never R-Co's `change.new_version`
  quirk), an unknown-ref rebind entry is appended rather than dropped, and
  `merge_effective_pins/3` (arity 2 → 3) now threads `started_event_id` so
  `source_event_id` is never `nil` for an un-rebound pin — see that design
  doc for the full reasoning "match R-Co exactly" was deliberately not
  assumed to be right for `resolved_id`.

  One further gap surfaced during implementation, not covered by the design
  doc's own OQ list:

    * **OQ-7 (implementation-time finding) — `tenant_id` is not in
      `resolve/4`'s own argument list**, but §4.2 of the design doc requires
      calling `lookup.variable_schema_lookup.(tenant_id, definition.name)`.
      `Letflow.Definitions.ProcessDefinition` carries no `tenant_id` field
      (schema-per-tenant, per `Letflow.Engine`'s own moduledoc "`tenant_id`
      is validated, never persisted"), and `resolve/4`'s specified 4-arg
      shape (`graph`, `definition`, `lookup`, `overrides`) has no other
      source for it either. This implementation passes `nil` as
      `tenant_id` to `variable_schema_lookup` — consistent with
      `default_lookup/0`'s own `variable_schema_lookup` ignoring its
      `tenant_id` argument entirely — and flags this for REVIEWER rather
      than silently inventing a 5th `resolve/4` argument the design's own
      §3 call site (`PinResolver.resolve(graph, definition,
      pin_lookup(attrs, prefix), pin_overrides(attrs))`) does not pass.

  PIN-04 AC1/AC5/AC7 — the **replay-time** effective pin set: seeds one
  `effective_pin()` per `instance_started_pinned_versions` entry
  (`source_event_id` from the caller-supplied `INSTANCE_STARTED` event id —
  see `reconstruct_effective_pins/2`), then folds every
  `INSTANCE_PINS_REBOUND` event in `pins_rebound_events` (caller's
  responsibility to pass pre-sorted by ascending `sequence_number` — this
  function trusts input order, matching `Reconstruction.fold_events/3`'s own
  discipline), applying each changed `{ref, new_version}` entry the rebind
  event's payload carries. Pure — zero I/O.

  Folds **all** `INSTANCE_PINS_REBOUND` events found, not just the most
  recent one (design doc §6, flagged OQ-2: REQ-060's own delta-only payload
  shape means folding only the single most-recent event would silently lose
  earlier rebinds of other refs).

  A rebound entry's `resolved_id` becomes `nil` (never `change.new_version`,
  never left at its pre-rebind value) and its `source` becomes `:rebound` —
  `PinRebind`'s payload never re-verifies a rebind against a catalog, so
  `nil` is the only `resolved_id` that doesn't assert a false identity; see
  `lib/letflow/design/iss-0078-pin-rebind-provenance.md` Decisions 1-2. An
  entry naming a `{kind, ref}` absent from the base set is **appended**, not
  dropped (Decision 3) — defensive-only, since PIN-05's own `UnknownPinRef`
  gate prevents this in normal operation.

  events/`events_archive` query is written here) with `min_sequence_number:
