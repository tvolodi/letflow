  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  EE-11 (REQ-053) — state reconstruction by event replay. Ports
  `reconstruction.zig`'s `reconstructInstance()` (R-Co's `src/design/engine.md`
  "Section EE-11: State Reconstruction", L5237). See
  `lib/letflow/design/req053-state-reconstruction.md` for the full design
  this module implements.

  ## Findings confirmed against shipped code, not assumed (design doc §1)

  * `Letflow.EventStore.read/2` does **not** span `events_archive` — its own
    pipeline (`query_instance_events/3` -> `resolve_payloads/2`) queries only
    the `events` table. `read_full_log/2` below is this requirement's own
    new, separate query, merging `events` and `events_archive` by
    `sequence_number` (the one total order preserved across an `archive/1`
    move — REQ-026's own design §7.3, INV-AR-1/AR-2).
  * Six `event_type` values are known to be appended for an instance as of
    REQ-187's own rework: `INSTANCE_STARTED`, `TASK_COMPLETED`,
    `INSTANCE_CANCELLED`, `EXECUTION_ERROR`, (req062, SPC-01)
    `SUB_PROCESS_COMPLETED`, and (REQ-187) `TIMER_FIRED`. `TIMER_FIRED`'s own
    persisted payload (`Letflow.Scheduler`'s `append_timer_fired_event/4`)
    carries `node_id`, no `token_id` — its replay clause mirrors
    `TASK_COMPLETED`'s own position-match shape, not `SUB_PROCESS_COMPLETED`'s
    marker-based one, and needs no variable-merge step (a `TIMER_FIRED`
    payload carries no `output_variables`). No `PARALLEL_SPLIT`/`PARALLEL_JOIN_*` event type
    is ever persisted (REQ-051's `pending_event()` union stays entirely
    in-memory). A later persisted event type needs its own replay clause
    added to `apply_event/3` below by whichever requirement adds it — any
    unrecognized `event_type` string surfaces as
    `{:replay_failed, {:unrecognized_event_type, event_type, event_id}}`,
    never silently skipped.
  * `SUB_PROCESS_COMPLETED`'s own persisted payload
    (`Letflow.Engine.SubProcess.append_sub_process_completed_event/8`) writes
    `child_instance_id`, `output_variables` (already
    interface-filtered/merge-ready — the same value
    `SubProcess.build_parent_merge_variables/2` produced on the live path,
    not the child's raw full variable map), `merged_variable_events`, and
    `activated_nodes`. It carries no `node_id` field at all (unlike
    `TASK_COMPLETED`) — replay below matches the completing token by its
    in-memory `waiting_child_instance_id` against the payload's
    `child_instance_id` instead, since that is the one field the payload
    actually carries that identifies which parked token this event closes.
  * `Letflow.Engine.Transition.transition/3` cannot replay from event payload
    alone: no persisted event payload records the `token_id`/`branch_id`
    `Letflow.Engine.create/2`/`complete_task/3` minted for that hop. Exact
    `token_id`/`branch_id` values are therefore **not** reconstructible
    bit-for-bit from the event log — only token **positions** (`node_id`s)
    are. Every token this module mints during replay uses a freshly
    generated `token_id` (`Ecto.UUID.generate/0`), never a value read back
    from any event.
  * `instance_projections.current_nodes` is a list of `node_id` strings, not
    full token records — a field-for-field comparison against the live
    projection is therefore necessarily over `current_nodes` (a
    node-id multiset), `variables`, and `status`, never over
    `InstanceState.tokens`'s richer `token_id`/`branch_id` fields, which have
    no projection-side counterpart at all.

  ## NFR-04 — R-Co's documented performance target (AC7, informational only)

  R-Co's EE-11 AC2 states a documented performance target — 10,000 events
  replayed in under 5 seconds (NFR-04). Letflow has not adopted an NFR
  requirement covering reconstruction performance, and no benchmark harness
  exists in this codebase as of this requirement. This target is recorded
  here as R-Co's documented context only; it is not a Letflow acceptance
  criterion, and no code in this module is written, tuned, or tested against
  it.

  ## Scope boundary (AC7)

  `POST /api/v1/instances/:id/reconstruct` is S4 (api-surface) scope, not
  built here. This module is the context-module function a future S4 route
  wraps.

  ## What "same tokens" means for AC1 (design doc §6)

  `reconstruct_instance/2`'s resulting `InstanceState.tokens` uses
  freshly-minted `token_id`/`branch_id` values on every call — these can
  never be compared byte-for-byte against either the original run's
  in-memory tokens (never persisted) or `instance_projections` (no
  `token_id`/`branch_id` column at all). "Same tokens" is therefore a
  node-id-multiset comparison against `current_nodes`, `variables`, and
  `status`; "task set" compares `pending_task_nodes`'s `node_id`s against
  the `tasks` table's own `:pending`-status rows for the instance (not
  `instance_projections`, which carries no task-set column at all) — see the
  design doc §6 for the full statement, including the flagged correction to
  the requirement text's literal "equal to the persisted instance_projections
  row" framing for that one field.

  ## Ground truth is the event log, never the projection (INV-RC-2)

  No function on the replay path (`read_full_log/2`, `replay/3`) ever reads
  `instance_projections` — only `write_back/4` (opt-in) touches that table,
  and only to write, never to seed replay state from it.

  ## Read-only by default (INV-RC-1)

  `reconstruct_instance(id, prefix: p)` (no `write_back` key, or
  `write_back: false`) performs zero `Repo.insert`/`update`/`delete` calls
  anywhere in its call graph. `write_back` defaults to `false`; omitting the
  key entirely from `opts` is equivalent to `write_back: false`, never
  treated as an error or as "unspecified -> true".

  ## Deliberate divergences from the design's literal text (flagged for
  ## REVIEWER, per this codebase's own established precedent for this class
  ## of gap — e.g. `Letflow.Engine`'s `merge_output_variables/5` widening
  ## beyond req061 design doc §5.1's literal 2-arg signature)

  1. **`write_back/3`'s third argument widened to an opts list.** The design
     doc §7 states `write_back(instance_id, InstanceState.t(), prefix)` and
     separately states (same section) that `last_event_seq` is set from the
     merged log's own `last_sequence_number` — a value `write_back/3`'s own
     3-arg literal signature has no way to receive. Implemented here as
     `write_back/3` with `opts :: [prefix: String.t(), last_sequence_number:
     non_neg_integer() | nil]` as the third argument, rather than either (a)
     silently guessing an incorrect `last_event_seq`, or (b) re-deriving it
     with a second, wasteful query inside `write_back/3` itself.
  2. **Write-back's insert path (projection row absent) fetches the
     instance's snapshot a second time to source `definition_id`.**
     `InstanceProjection.insert_changeset/2` requires `definition_id`, which
     has no `InstanceState.t()` counterpart (design doc §7's own insert
     extension does not name where this required field comes from). Sourced
     here from `Letflow.Definitions.SnapshotStore.get_by_instance_id/2`
     (already known to exist — `replay/3` would otherwise have already
     returned `:instance_not_found`/`{:replay_failed,
     {:snapshot_unavailable, _}}`). `correlation_key` is left `nil` on this
     insert path — it has no `InstanceState.t()` counterpart either and this
     module does not re-read `INSTANCE_STARTED`'s own payload a second time
     just to recover it; a genuinely correlation-key-bearing instance whose
     projection row was deleted and then write-back-inserted loses that one
     informational field until a later write repopulates it.
  3. **`replay_failure_reason()` gains two variants beyond the design doc
     §3 type block's literal list**, both explicitly anticipated by the design
     doc's own prose even though omitted from that literal `@type` block:
     `{:duplicate_sequence_number, sequence_number}` (design doc §4) and
     `{:ambiguous_task_node, node_id}` (design doc §5.3/§9 OQ-3).
  4. **`{:variable_merge_rejected, event_id, key}` — a new variant with no
     design doc precedent at all.** `TASK_COMPLETED` replay merges
     `payload.output_variables` via `Letflow.Engine.VariableMerge.merge/3`
     (design doc §5.3), reusing the exact call `complete_task/3` itself
     makes — but `complete_task/3`'s own call site routes a `:rejected`
     merge outcome into `Letflow.Engine.ExecutionError` (REQ-061,
     `engine.ex:1093-1106`), a write-path this module never takes (INV-RC-1,
     INV-RC-2). The design doc's §5.3 table does not name this case. Since a
     `TASK_COMPLETED` event was only ever durably appended after its own
     original `merge/3` call already succeeded, replaying it against the same
     durable variable state should not be able to observe a rejection in
     practice — this variant exists purely so an actual occurrence (a
     genuine data-integrity condition, e.g. a schema tightened after the
     fact) surfaces as a named, pattern-matchable replay failure instead of
     crashing or being silently absorbed.

  ## REQ-054 — snapshot-aware replay-source selection

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  `read_full_log/2` is widened to `read_full_log/3`, taking a new
  `min_sequence_number` argument (defaulting to `1` for every existing
  full-replay caller) — the same class of deliberate, additive-arity
  divergence as `write_back/3`'s opts-list widening above, not a change to
  the merge/dedup logic itself. `replay/3` becomes `replay/4`: its new
  first step, `select_replay_source/2` (ports `reconstruction.zig`'s
  `determineReplaySourceForSnapshot()`), asks
  `Letflow.Engine.SnapshotWriter.latest_snapshot/2` — a **different**
  snapshot table from the `SnapshotStore.get_by_instance_id/2` call
  immediately below it in `replay/4`'s body (`instance_state_snapshots`,
  periodic execution state, vs. `instance_definition_snapshots`, the
  immutable PD-08 graph — see `Letflow.Engine.SnapshotWriter`'s moduledoc
  for the full distinction) — whether a prior execution-state snapshot
  exists for this instance. When one does, `replay/4` seeds `fold_events/3`
  from that snapshot's deserialised `InstanceState.t()` instead of a fresh
  `:START` token, and folds only events with `sequence_number` greater than
  the snapshot's own — `fold_events/3` and every `apply_event/3` clause are
  unchanged, so a divergence between the snapshot-sourced and full-replay
  results (INV-ISS-1, `lib/letflow/design/req054-instance-state-snapshots.md`
  §5.4) can only come from the snapshot's serialise/deserialise round-trip,
  never from two different fold implementations drifting apart.

  ## OQ-1 (two-query race, design doc §9) — not closed by this
  ## implementation

  `read_full_log/2`'s two queries run inside one `Repo.transaction/2` under
  Postgres's default `READ COMMITTED` isolation, querying `events_archive`
  first (the design doc's own argued-safe ordering, since `archive/1` only
  ever moves rows into it, never out). This implementation does not upgrade
  to `REPEATABLE READ`/`SERIALIZABLE` — left exactly as the design doc
  flagged it, for REVIEWER to confirm sufficiency.
