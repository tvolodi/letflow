defmodule Letflow.Engine.Wasm.HostApi do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-171 (WASM-12 read half) — the WASM ABI's equivalent of
  `Letflow.Engine.Lua.Platform`'s `do_read_variable/do_log/now` trio, for the four
  functions this requirement owns: `read_variable`, `log`, `now`, `uuid`. REQ-172 adds
  `do_write_variable`/`do_call_service`/`do_fail` to this same module (mirroring
  `platform.ex` hosting both REQ-159's and REQ-160's implementations in one file).

  See `lib/letflow/design/req171-wasm-host-api-read.md` (gate-approved) for the full
  design this module implements, in particular §1's live-verified `wasmex` v0.15.1
  callback ABI findings this module's shape depends on.

  ## Per decision 0014 (4): the Lua host API is the definition WASM conforms to

  Every semantic rule this module restates is read from
  `lib/letflow/engine/lua/platform.ex`, never re-derived. This module does not modify
  that file or any file under `lib/letflow/engine/lua/`.

  ## Capability source — REQ-167

  Gating for every function this module defines comes exclusively from
  `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.CapabilityGate`'s manifest-derived import-table whitelist
  (`build_import_table/1,2`) — no second capability model is introduced here.
  `read_variable` requires `"var:read"`, `log` requires `"audit:log"`, `now`/`uuid` are
  `:none`-gated (always installed, never denied) — see `capability_gate.ex`'s
  `@known_imports`. No function in this module performs a capability check itself; by
  the time any `do_*` function below runs, `CapabilityGate`'s import-table membership
  has already been the only gate applied (design §4.7).

  ## Tenant boundary (AC8, decision 0014 (e))

  Identical statement to REQ-159's own: host functions receive already-resolved
  values; the tenant prefix is supplied by the calling engine code, never derived
  inside a script. **No function this module defines calls `Letflow.Repo`, ever** —
  none of `read_variable`/`log`/`now`/`uuid` touches persistence. `execution_context`
  is supplied by whatever future dispatch-integration requirement calls
  `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.CapabilityGate.build_import_table/2` — never derived from a
  guest-supplied argument, never read from guest memory.

  ## Number marshalling (AC6) — REQ-150 §2.2, no second rule

  `read_variable`'s value is routed through
  `Letflow.Engine.LuaNumberMarshalling.to_lua/1` (REQ-150 §2.2, the read-direction
  identity rule for `integer()`/`float()`/`nil`) before being JSON-encoded onto the
  wire — exactly the same call `platform.ex`'s own `do_read_variable/3` makes before
  its `Lua.encode!/2` step. `Jason.encode!/1` is what makes the integer/float subtype
  visible on the wire; `to_lua/1`'s job is only to guarantee no coercion happened
  before that encoding step. One function, one call site pattern, reused verbatim —
  no WASM-specific numeric companion module exists or is needed.

  ## `uuid` has no Lua counterpart (AC5)

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  `uuid` does not appear in `platform.ex`'s 8-row `@capability_matrix` — R-Co's
  `src/wasm/host_api/uuid.zig` had no Lua-side sibling either, an asymmetry that
  predates Letflow's migration. This requirement implements `uuid` as a **documented
  WASM-side addition, with no Lua-side counterpart introduced**: it shares `now`'s own
  capability rationale (a pure
  computation with no state reach, no tenant-data touch, no side effect), requires no
  Lua-side file edit, and reuses the existing `:none` gating mechanism. Whether Lua
  scripts should also gain a `platform.uuid()` is flagged as a candidate finding for
  ORCH, not resolved by this requirement.

  ## Callback ABI (Findings 1/4, design §1)

  Every `do_*` function's first argument is the raw `wasmex_callback_context()` map
  `wasmex` hands every callback — never narrowed or renamed — so
  `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.MemoryGuard.read/4`/`.write/4` are called with
  `context.caller`/`context.memory` directly, fetched fresh on every invocation (never
  a store/memory handle captured at import-table-construction time — `wasmex`'s own
  moduledoc warns a captured `store` can deadlock the call). `execution_context` is
  always the last argument, closed over by
  `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.CapabilityGate.build_import_table/2`'s fold — never part of the
  guest-visible call signature.

  ## Shared string-return buffer protocol (§5.2)

  Every function here that returns a string-shaped value to the guest
  (`read_variable`, `now`, `uuid`) shares one protocol: the **guest**, not the host,
  owns buffer allocation (`out_ptr`, `out_cap`), which avoids ever needing to call the
  guest's own `alloc` export mid-callback (a re-entrant-guest-call hazard `wasmex`'s
  `GenServer.call`-shaped dispatch makes dangerous). One `i32` result, three disjoint
  ranges:

    * `n >= 0` — `n` is the exact byte length of the UTF-8-encoded result. If
      `out_cap >= n`, the host has already written those `n` bytes to `out_ptr`. If
      `out_cap < n`, the host has written nothing — the guest must call again with a
      buffer of at least `n` bytes.
    * `-1` — **`read_variable`-only.** The variable is not present in
      `execution_context.variables` (the same convention Lua's own `nil` represents
      for an unset variable).
      Never returned by `now`/`uuid` (both always have a value).
    * `-2` — invalid argument: an input or output pointer/length pair failed
      `MemoryGuard`'s bounds check, or (`read_variable` only) the name bytes read back
      are not valid UTF-8. No bytes are written.

  ## Semantic differences from Lua (AC6, design §9)

  WASM-12 limits this module's differences from `platform.ex` to ABI only (string
  encoding, return-envelope shape) — so an unlisted non-ABI difference means the
  requirement is unmet. Five are known, each with its justification:

    * **9.1 — `write_variable`'s wall-clock-timeout discard arm is abandonment, not
      destruction.** The observable guarantee (no caller ever commits the write) is
      identical to Lua's; the underlying mechanism is not — a timed-out WASM
      invocation's process is leaked, never killed, because no BEAM-side mechanism can
      terminate it (inherited from `CallTimeout`'s already-accepted REQ-170/decision
      0014 WASM-11 finding; this requirement only states the consequence for staged
      writes honestly rather than implying a uniform "process death" story).
    * **9.2 — `write_variable`'s "malformed name" arm has no WASM equivalent.** Lua's
      `do_write_variable/2` has a real non-binary-`name`-argument arm because Lua is
      dynamically typed; WASM's ABI only ever delivers a `(ptr, len)` byte pair for
      `name`, which is inherently string-shaped, so the only ways it can be malformed
      are already covered by the `-2` (bad pointer / invalid UTF-8) code. A consequence
      of the two languages' own type systems, not a design choice.
    * **9.3 — the capability token is `"var:write"`, not Lua's `"variable:write"`.**
      Pre-existing token-space divergence inherited from REQ-167/171 (`"var:read"` vs.
      `"variable:read"` already diverged before this requirement) — not introduced or
      newly decided here.
    * **9.4 — `call_service`'s missing-capability granularity is coarser on WASM than
      on Lua.** Lua's `"service:call:<id>"` is parameterized per service, checked at
      call time; WASM's `"service:call"` is a single, unparameterized capability
      checked once at import-table-construction time — once granted, a WASM guest may
      call `call_service` for any `service_id`, where an equivalently-configured Lua
      script would still be denied per-service. This is **accepted, not fixed**:
      closing the granularity gap inside `do_call_service`'s body would require either
      raising (forbidden by INV-HOSTAPI-2) or a second structured-error shape
      indistinguishable from an ordinary service failure (defeating AC4's requirement
      that the two be assertable distinctly).
    * **9.5 — `fail`'s discard/observation mechanism is structurally different on WASM
      than on Lua, not merely differently wrapped.** On Lua, `exit/1` crashes the
      process actually running the script, observed directly. On WASM, `exit/1` inside
      `do_fail/5` is caught internally by `wasmex`'s own callback dispatch — the
      instance process never crashes at all — so `fail` is distinguishable from a guest
      trap or an accidental callback bug only via the `@fail_signal_pdict_key`
      process-dictionary signal stashed before `exit/1`, a mechanism with no Lua-side
      analogue. The underlying mechanisms are genuinely different in kind, not just in
      return-value depth.

  No other non-ABI semantic difference is known. Any ELIXIR-DEV's implementation
  discovers that is not listed here is a defect against the design.

  ## Invariants

    * INV-HOSTAPI-1: no function this module defines calls `Letflow.Repo`, ever.
    * INV-HOSTAPI-2: no function this module defines raises, ever (a callback that
      raises produces the same opaque, indistinguishable-from-a-trap
      `{:error, binary()}` from `Wasmex.call_function/4` as a type-mismatched return —
      design §1 Finding 3 — so correctness must come from every callback body always
      returning a well-typed value). **One explicit, permanent exception (REQ-172
      design §7): `do_fail/5`.** Its entire purpose is a deliberate `exit/1` call —
      live-verified (REQ-172 design §2.1/§2.2) to NOT crash the Wasmex instance
      process, instead aborting the guest's in-flight call via Wasmtime's own
      host-function-failure propagation, made distinguishable from a trap/accidental
      bug via a process-dictionary signal (`@fail_signal_pdict_key`) stashed
      immediately before the `exit/1` call.
    * INV-HOSTAPI-3: every guest memory access goes through
      `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.MemoryGuard.read/4` or `.write/4` — never `Wasmex.Memory.*`
      directly.
    * INV-HOSTAPI-4: `execution_context` is never constructed from guest-supplied
      bytes — always the value closed over at
      `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.CapabilityGate.build_import_table/2` call time.
