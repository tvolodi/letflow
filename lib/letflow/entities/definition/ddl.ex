defmodule Letflow.Entities.Definition.DDL do
  @moduledoc """
  Generates the `CREATE TABLE` DDL text for one entity type's per-tenant
  table, as a pure function of `Letflow.Entities.Definition.t()` (REQ-296).
  See `lib/letflow/design/req296-entity-table-ddl-generator.md` for the full
  design this module implements.

  ## Pure function -- no I/O, no tenant/schema awareness

  This module never calls `Letflow.Repo`, never opens a database
  connection, and never knows which tenant or schema a table belongs to.
  It only turns a `Letflow.Entities.Definition.t()` (plus a caller-supplied
  `table_name`) into raw SQL text. Deciding the physical `table_name` from
  an `entity_type`, executing the returned SQL against a real schema, and
  wiring promoted columns into any write path are all REQ-297/298's job,
  not this module's (see `docs/migration/decisions/0023-entity-storage-hybrid.md`
  and `docs/migration/decisions/0024-entity-promotion-ddl-execution.md`).

  ## Precondition: the definition has already passed `Validator.validate/1`

  Callers must have already run `Letflow.Entities.Definition.Validator.validate/1`
  on `definition` and received `:ok` before calling `generate_table_ddl/2` --
  this module does not re-run structural validation (FK coverage, the
  `:json`/`queried` conflict, name-format checks). It leans on those
  already-enforced invariants. The one exception is `valid_identifier?/1`
  (see below), which this module checks itself anyway, as a defence-in-depth
  measure independent of the Validator's own name-format rule, because a
  SQL-injection-shaped defect is exactly the kind of failure that should not
  depend solely on an upstream precondition silently continuing to hold.

  ## Output form: raw SQL text, not an `Ecto.Migration` AST

  `generate_table_ddl/2` returns `{:ok, sql}` where `sql` is a complete
  `CREATE TABLE` statement as a `String.t()` -- not an `Ecto.Migration`
  macro call list. This matches REQ-295/297's own `ALTER TABLE ... ADD
  COLUMN` half of table DDL, which already executes raw SQL text directly
  (the same way `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.provision_tenant_schema/1`
  already executes `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS ...` directly rather than
  through the migrator) -- one representation used consistently across both
  halves of table DDL, not two.

  ## REQ-301 -- generated-column-per-locale for `:localized_text`

  `promoted_columns/1`'s per-field dispatch (via `field_type_to_pg_type/1`
  and `promotion_trigger/2`) is a closed case dispatch over
  `Definition.field_type()`. A `:localized_text` field (REQ-301) dispatches
  instead to `localized_text_column_specs/1`, which emits one generated
  column per configured locale -- either a plain `text` column or a
  `tsvector` column, selected per-field by the field's `search_strategy`
  attribute (`:plain`, the default, or `:fulltext`). This per-field choice
  is `docs/migration/decisions/0025-promoted-fk-ondelete-and-localized-text-search-strategy.md`
  "Sub-question 2"'s decision, implemented here verbatim -- see that record
  for the reasoning; it is not re-derived in this module. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req301-localized-text-field-type.md` for the full
  design this section implements.

  ## ON DELETE policy for promoted FK columns (REQ-298)

  Every promoted-FK-column `REFERENCES` constraint this module emits carries
  a fixed, unconditional `ON DELETE RESTRICT` clause (Ecto:
  `on_delete: :restrict`), per
  `docs/migration/decisions/0025-promoted-fk-ondelete-and-localized-text-search-strategy.md`,
  "Decision" section, "Sub-question 1 -- `ON DELETE RESTRICT`": *"Every
  promoted-FK-column `REFERENCES` constraint uses **`ON DELETE RESTRICT`**
  (Ecto: `on_delete: :restrict`)."* This module does not re-derive or
  second-guess that record's reconciliation of `ON DELETE RESTRICT` against
  `Letflow.Entities.Records.delete_record/2`'s soft-delete semantics -- 0025
  already did that reasoning; this module only implements its answer.

  Generates the full `CREATE TABLE` DDL text for `definition`'s per-entity-type
  table, named `table_name`.

  `table_name` is supplied by the caller (REQ-297/provisioning's job to
  derive a physical table name from `entity_type`) -- this module does not
  invent a table-naming convention; it validates whatever name it is given
  and uses it verbatim in the emitted `CREATE TABLE "<table_name>" (...)`.

  `fk_target_tables` (REQ-298) maps every `references_entity` value named by
  `definition.foreign_keys` to its already-resolved physical table name.
  This module never resolves an `entity_type -> table_name` mapping itself
  (per its own "pure function, no I/O, no tenant/schema awareness"
  invariant) -- that is the caller's job
  (`Letflow.TenantProvisioning.table_name_for_entity_type/1`), same as
  `table_name` (the entity type's own physical name) already is today.
  Defaults to `%{}`, so every existing 2-arity call site (a definition with
  no `foreign_keys`) keeps compiling and behaving identically. If
  `definition.foreign_keys` names a `references_entity` absent from
  `fk_target_tables`, this function returns
  `{:error, {:missing_fk_target_table, entity_type: that_entity_type}}`
  rather than silently omitting the `REFERENCES` clause or guessing a table
  name.

  Returns `{:error, ddl_error()}` for a defence-in-depth identifier-shape
  failure (`table_name`, a promoted column name, or a `constraint_def`'s
  name/fields not matching the safe identifier format), or for a missing FK
  target table -- never for a structurally-invalid `Definition.t()`, which
  is the Validator's job and is assumed already passed per the precondition
  stated in the moduledoc.
