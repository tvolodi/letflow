defmodule Letflow.Entities.EventTypes do
  @moduledoc """
  One-time seed step registering the three entity-record event types
  (REQ-228) through the **existing**
  `Letflow.EventStore.Registry.register_type/2` — no parallel registration
  mechanism. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req228-entity-event-registration-commands.md` §4 for
  the full design this module implements.

  ## The inner/outer validation split (AC7)

  `register_type/2`'s `json_schema` here validates only the **outer** event
  envelope — that `entity_type`/`entity_def_version`/`record_id`/
  `field_values` are present and correctly typed as a JSON object. It never
  inspects `field_values`'s own keys. Per-entity-definition field constraint
  checking is `Letflow.Entities.Record.Validator.validate_record_payload/2`'s
  (REQ-227) job alone, run before this envelope validation, inside
  `Letflow.Entities.Records`'s command functions.

  ## `entity_def_version`'s wire representation — a flagged, documented
  divergence from the design's literal §4.1 envelope table

  The design's own §4.1 table declares `entity_def_version` as JSON
  `"type": "integer"` in the outer envelope schema, while simultaneously
  stating (same section) that `entity_def_version` carries
  `entity_definitions.logical_shape_version`'s ordinal role — a column that
  is actually a `:binary` content-hash digest, never an integer counter
  (confirmed directly against `Letflow.Entities.EntityDefinition`'s schema).
  A raw binary hash cannot be embedded in a JSON payload directly (Jason
  requires valid UTF-8), and it is not an integer either, so the design's
  literal `"type": "integer"` declaration cannot be satisfied by the actual
  data it is meant to describe. The design itself names this exact gap as an
  open question (§8 item 1), explicitly inviting ELIXIR-DEV/REQ-229 to
  resolve it against `EntityDefinition.t()`'s actual field "rather than
  silently picked here."

  Resolution (flagged for REVIEWER, not silently chosen): the envelope's
  `entity_def_version` property is registered here as `"type": "string"`,
  and `Letflow.Entities.Records` hex-encodes `logical_shape_version`
  (`Base.encode16/2`, lowercase) into that field when building an event
  payload, decoding it back (`Base.decode16!/2`) when reconstructing a
  duplicate-submission's record from a replayed event's stored payload. The
  persisted `entity_record_latest.entity_def_version` column stays `:binary`
  (design §6.1's literal column type) and is populated directly from the
  in-memory `definition.logical_shape_version` value on the write path
  (never round-tripped through the JSON envelope), and from
  `Base.decode16!/2` of the envelope's hex string on the duplicate-replay
  path.

  Registers `ENTITY_RECORD_CREATED`, `ENTITY_RECORD_UPDATED`,

  scoped to the tenant schema named by `prefix`.

  Idempotent across repeated calls (design §4): a
  `{:error, :duplicate_event_type_version}` for one of the three is treated
  as "already registered, not a failure" and that event type's `name` is
  added to `skipped` rather than aborting the whole seed. Any other error
  return aborts immediately as `{:error, reason}`, leaving `registered`
  whatever this call itself managed to insert before the failure (not
  rolled back — `register_type/2` has no transactional grouping across the
  three calls, matching every other platform event-type seed call site in
  this codebase).
