defmodule Letflow.Entities.Query.FieldGrants do
  @moduledoc """
  `field_grants.zig`-equivalent (REQ-231 §3) -- a per-user, per-entity-type/
  field access-control loader that redacts specific fields from a query
  result row (not the whole row), per QRY-05. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req231-entity-query-cursor-field-grants.md` §3 for
  the full design this module implements.

  ## New tables, not an existing primitive (design §3.1)

  Field-grant redaction does not map onto any existing Letflow
  authorization/RBAC primitive. `Letflow.Api.Authorization` (REQ-069) is
  coarse, route/action-level, all-or-nothing -- its own INV-2 states there
  is no third parameter through which "which field" could reach
  `evaluate_access/2` without breaking that module's pure, two-argument
  contract. `Letflow.Secrets.Redaction` (REQ-190) is a global,
  identity-blind key-name denylist with no `user_id` concept at all. Both
  modules were read in full for this design (see the design doc's §3.1);
  neither fits. This module is backed by two new, dedicated tenant-schema
  tables instead: `entity_field_restrictions` (default-deny) and
  `user_entity_grants` (per-user override) -- design §3.2.

  ## Grant model -- default-deny-with-explicit-override (design §3.2)

  A field with no `entity_field_restrictions` row is visible to every user
  unconditionally. A restricted field's *absence* from a given user's
  `user_entity_grants` rows is exactly that user's redaction set for that
  entity type.

  ## Redaction mechanism -- sentinel value, key retained (design §3.4)

  The key stays present in the returned `field_values` map; its value is
  replaced by the atom sentinel `:__field_redacted__` -- distinct from
  `Letflow.Secrets.Redaction`'s own `"[REDACTED]"` **string** literal
  deliberately, since a JSONB-sourced `field_values` map can legitimately
  contain that literal string as real business data, whereas an atom
  sentinel cannot collide with any JSON-decoded value (JSON has no atom
  type). Omission and `nil` were both rejected (design §3.4) since either
  is ambiguous with "this record never set this field" -- a present key
  with this sentinel states "data exists, you may not see it" unambiguously.

  This module uses schemaless `Ecto.Query`s against `entity_field_restrictions`/
  `user_entity_grants` (`from(x in "table_name", ...)`) rather than
  introducing new `Ecto.Schema` modules -- design §4 names only
  `Letflow.Entities.Query.Cursor`/`Letflow.Entities.Query.FieldGrants` as
  this slice's new modules, and this design specifies the tables and the
  read-side loader/redactor only (§5) -- a future write-path requirement
  owns authoring these rows and can add schema modules then if it needs
  them.

  # `load_restrictions/3` call per distinct entity type present (primary's

  # keyed under that string; `through`'s own entity type is not included,

  # §4). This is the direct answer to AC5's "keyed by entity-type-of-each-field,
  # not just the primary entity type": a joined entity's own restriction set
  # governs its own fields; the primary's redaction never leaks onto a
  # joined entity's fields and vice versa, because each is resolved and
  # redacted independently.

  # For a non-join request (`join` absent/empty), `redact_page/2` continues
