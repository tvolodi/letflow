defmodule Letflow.Entities.Record.Validator do
  @moduledoc """
  Validates one entity record's `field_values` payload against the
  JSON-Schema-shaped constraint set derived from its REQ-225
  `Letflow.Entities.Definition.t()` document (REQ-227). See
  `lib/letflow/design/req227-entity-record-payload-validation.md` for the
  full design this module implements.

  ## Reuses `Letflow.EventStore.Registry.JsonSchema` -- no second engine

  This module performs **no constraint-checking logic of its own**.
  `build_record_schema/1` only reshapes a REQ-225 definition's `fields` list
  into a plain, string-keyed JSON-Schema-shaped map (data reshaping, not
  evaluation); `validate_record_payload/2` then delegates the actual
  checking to the existing `Letflow.EventStore.Registry.JsonSchema.validate/2`
  (REQ-024), returning its violation list unchanged. See the design doc §5.1
  for why this cross-namespace reach is accepted as-is rather than extracting
  a shared top-level module: `JsonSchema` is already a pure, dependency-free
  leaf module with an existing cross-namespace caller
  (`Letflow.Definitions.JsonSchemaShape`), and extraction now would touch
  `Letflow.EventStore.Registry`'s own call site and tests for zero behavior
  change.

  ## Scope boundary

  This module validates only a record's `field_values` map against its
  definition's derived schema (the **inner** check). It does not validate
  the outer event envelope (`Letflow.EventStore.Registry.validate_payload/3`,
  a separate, pre-existing concern) and defines no route, controller, event
  registration, or command function -- all REQ-228's job (design doc §3/§7).

  ## Malformed-shape precondition (design §4 preamble)

  `definition` is expected to have already passed
  `Letflow.Entities.Definition.Validator.validate/1` (`:ok`) -- same divide
  of responsibility `Letflow.Entities.Definition.Shape` already documents.
  `build_record_schema/1` does not re-run those structural rules.

  # ISS-0617 / GH#1294 fix: `:localized_text` (REQ-301) was declarable,
  # DDL-supported (`Letflow.Entities.Definition.Ddl.localized_text_column_specs/1`),
  # and queryable, but had no clause here -- a definition with a
  # `:localized_text` field validated cleanly (Definition.Validator has no
  # opinion on record-payload shape) yet every record write raised
  # `FunctionClauseError` out of this function, an INV-8-shaped
  # crash-on-realistic-input defect in the same family as the
  # `properties_violations/3` fix at `JsonSchema` ISS-0088/GH#305 (see that
  # module's comment): realistic, schema-declared input reaching an
  # unguarded clause set.
  #
  # Storage shape (`ddl.ex` `localized_text_column_specs/1`, which reads
  # `field_values["<name>"]["<locale>"]` via
  # `field_values->'<name>'->>'<locale>'`) requires the field's value to be
  # a JSON object keyed by locale code with string values -- hence
  # `"type" => "object"` with one string-typed property per declared
  # locale, not a flat scalar like the other seven types.
  #
  # `additionalProperties: false` is set here explicitly, not inherited:
  # the outer schema's own `additionalProperties: false` (`build_record_schema/1`)
  # only governs top-level field NAMES against `field_values`'s
  # `"properties"` map (see `JsonSchema.additional_properties_violations/2`,
  # which reads `schema["additionalProperties"]`/`schema["properties"]` at
  # whatever level it is called from) -- it does not cascade into a nested
  # object subschema. Without setting it again here, a payload could smuggle
  # an undeclared locale key (e.g. `"fr"` on a field declared with only
  # `["kk", "ru"]`) past validation with no rejection.
  #
  # Deliberately no `"required" => locales`: every per-locale generated
  # column `localized_text_column_specs/1` emits is `nullable: true` (ddl.ex
  # `localized_text_column_specs/1`'s `column_spec()`), i.e. the DDL layer
  # already treats a missing/absent locale as a legitimate, queryable state
  # (`NULL`), not an error condition -- forcing every declared locale to be
  # present on every write here would reject storage-legitimate partial
  # writes the DDL was deliberately built to allow (e.g. a record whose
  # `"ru"` translation is filled in first, `"kk"` added later). Declared,
  # present locale keys are still constrained to `"type" => "string"`, and
  # `additionalProperties: false` still rejects any undeclared locale key --
  # only per-locale *presence* is optional, not the value's type or the
  # locale-key set itself.
