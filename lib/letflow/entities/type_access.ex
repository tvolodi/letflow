  @moduledoc """
  Per-`(user, entity_type)` authorization -- REQ-394. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req394-per-entity-type-authorization.md` §1 for the
  full design this module implements.

  ## Not a `FieldGrants` extension -- a new, sibling layer (design §0/§1)

  `Letflow.Entities.Query.FieldGrants` (REQ-231) redacts individual
  `field_values` keys within a record the caller can already see. It has no
  concept of denying an entire entity *type*. This module closes that gap,
  one level up, and is consumed by both the query path
  (`Letflow.Routers.Entities.run_query/4`) and the definitions-read path
  (`Letflow.Routers.Entities.render_get_definition/3`) alike -- not the
  query engine alone -- which is why it lives at `lib/letflow/entities/`,
  a sibling of `Letflow.Entities.Definitions`, rather than nested under
  `query/` the way `FieldGrants` is.

  ## Grant model -- default-allow, explicit restriction, per-user override (design §1.1)

  An entity type with no `entity_type_restrictions` row is visible to
  every user who holds the relevant coarse route-level permission
  (`:EntitiesQuery`/`:EntitiesDefinitionsRead`) -- a tenant that never
  inserts a single `entity_type_restrictions` row observes zero behavior
  change from this module's existence.

  A restricted entity type (a row exists in `entity_type_restrictions`
  naming it) is hidden from every user **except** one holding a matching
  `user_entity_type_grants` row for `(user_id, entity_type)`. Absence of
  that grant row is exactly that user's denial -- the same
  "restriction's absence from a given user's override rows is exactly
  that user's denial set" shape `FieldGrants` already uses, one level up.

  ## `authorized?/3` is not an existence oracle (design §1.3)

  `entity_type` here is always a caller-supplied or definition-resolved
  string, never validated against `entity_definitions` by this function --
  it answers "is this user denied *if* this type is restricted," not "does
  this type exist." Existence is resolved by the caller, exactly once, at
  the call site that already needs to know it for its own reasons
  (`Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler.compile/2`'s `entity_type_not_found`,
  or the definitions getters' own `{:error, :not_found}`).

  ## New tables, no `Ecto.Schema` module (design §1.2)

  `entity_type_restrictions` (no FK to `entity_definitions` -- queried by
  string name, same convention `Letflow.Entities.Query.Allowlist.load/2`
  already uses) and `user_entity_type_grants` (`user_id` FK to `users`).
  Neither has a schema module -- same deliberate choice `FieldGrants` made
  for its own two tables: this module's own scope is the read-side
  loader/checker only; a future write-path requirement owns authoring
  these rows.
