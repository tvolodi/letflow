defmodule Letflow.Exam.Certificate do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-355 -- idempotent issue-on-first-request certificate issuance. Ported
  from `backend/internal/certificates/service.go`'s `GetOrCreate`
  (FR-BB43, migration `019_certificates.up.sql`, spec
  `docs/requirements/FR-BB43.Certificate-generation.md`) --
  `c:\\Users\\tvolo\\dev\\ai-dala\\BilimBaga\\backend\\internal\\certificates\\`.
  Per this stage's own "the Go code does not transfer" rule, only the
  BEHAVIOUR is ported: a fixed-order guard pipeline, then
  return-existing-if-already-issued, then a branding-snapshot capture and
  insert.

  ## Rule-2 justification -- flagged for REVIEWER, NOT self-adjudicated here

  REQ-355's own requirements.yaml entry states plainly that this module
  needs a per-entry rule-2 sign-off that the entry itself deliberately does
  NOT contain, because writing it is REVIEWER's job, not
  REQ-ANALYST's/ELIXIR-DEV's. The honest A/B question REVIEWER must answer:
  a certificate record is largely declarative and its issuance is close to
  an ordinary entity-record create, so "why is this not simply bucket A
  pack content plus the existing `Letflow.Entities.Records` write surface"
  is a real question with a real candidate answer, not a formality. This
  module's own candidate answer, for REVIEWER to weigh: the eligibility
  rule set below (session submitted, session passed -- itself a
  three-valued read that must not be collapsed with "not submitted", exam
  `certificate_enabled`) cannot be stated without naming exams and
  sessions (0022 rule 1), and the ordered-guard-then-idempotent-write
  sequence is a multi-step `with`-chain with no execution semantics an
  entity definition alone can express -- the same shape
  `Letflow.Exam.Session`'s own rule-2 table already established for this
  vertical. This module does NOT self-certify that answer as sufficient;
  it is recorded here only so REVIEWER's sign-off (to be written into
  `docs/migration/stage-10-bilimbaga-vertical.md`'s "## REVIEWER sign-off"
  section, per that section's own established precedent) has this
  module's own reasoning in view, not a blank page.

  ## Data lives in bucket A -- no migration, no Ecto schema here

  Every read and write goes through `Letflow.Entities.Records` (create) and
  `Letflow.Exam.Session.get_session_for_user/3` (session read, which already
  owns ownership/not-found semantics -- reused here rather than
  re-implemented) and `Letflow.Entities.Record.Latest` (the `exam` read).
  `certificate` (REQ-355) is the only entity type this module writes; extra
  reads are `Letflow.Identity`'s `users` table (candidate display name) and
  `Letflow.Identity.Tenant` (branding).

  ## Guard order (service.go's `GetOrCreate`, read top to bottom)

  1. Ownership, unless admin -- **admin bypass is NOT wired**: REQ-355's own
     scope fence is "an authenticated route by which a candidate requests
     issuance for their own session," not an admin route, so there is no
     caller today that could ever pass `is_admin: true`. Rather than carry
     an unreachable parameter no route calls (the shape
     `Letflow.Exam.Session`'s own `:not_assigned` no-op takes for a
     genuinely-blocked check), this function's ownership check is simply
     unconditional -- `Session.get_session_for_user/3`'s own
     `:not_owner`/`:session_not_found` pair, already indistinguishable per
     INV-5 (that function's own `@doc`/the session router's moduledoc).
     Adding an admin bypass is future work for whichever requirement
     authorizes an admin certificate route, not something to fake here.
  2. Session status is `:grading_pending` -> `{:error, :grading_pending}`,
     checked and returned BEFORE the generic "not submitted" guard and
     BEFORE the "not passed" guard -- see "grading_pending is not a passed=false"
     below for why this is its own guard with its own atom, not folded into
     either.
  3. Session status must be `:submitted` (not `:in_progress`,
     `:auto_submitted`, or -- per guard 2 above -- `:grading_pending`) ->
     `{:error, :session_not_submitted}` otherwise. Source AC-4.
  4. Exam must have `certificate_enabled: true` ->
     `{:error, :exam_not_certifiable}` otherwise. Source AC-2.
  5. Session must have passed -> `{:error, :session_not_passed}` otherwise.
     Source AC-3. By this point `status == :submitted` is already
     established (guard 3), so `Session.get_session_for_user/3`'s own
     `passed_for_status/2` guarantees `passed` is a real `true`/`false`
     here, never `nil` -- guard 2 already intercepted the only status that
     produces `nil`.
  6. Return existing if already issued, else capture a branding snapshot
     and insert. Source AC-5/AC-9/AC-10 -- see "Idempotency" below.

  ## `grading_pending` is not a `passed: false` refusal -- REQ-355's own required distinction

  `lib/letflow/exam/scoring.ex:255-257` forces `status: :grading_pending`
  and `passed: nil` for any session containing a `:short_text` question.
  The source's own AC-3 collapses "passed = false" and "passed is null"
  into ONE `ErrNotPassed`/`SESSION_NOT_PASSED` refusal -- correct for the
  source, which has a manual short-text grading queue that could later
  resolve `nil` into `true`. Letflow has no such queue
  (`lib/letflow/routers/exam_sessions.ex`'s own scope fence says so
  plainly), so a `grading_pending` session here can NEVER later become
  `passed`. Collapsing the two would tell a candidate whose session is
  merely awaiting grading the same "you failed" message told to a
  candidate who genuinely scored below the passing threshold -- dishonest
  in a way the source's own design did not intend and could not have,
  since its queue makes the collapse temporary there and permanent here.
  `check_not_grading_pending/1` below is therefore its own guard, fired
  before the generic submitted-status guard, with its own `:grading_pending`
  atom -- distinct from both `:session_not_submitted` (an honest "not
  submitted yet, come back after you finish/submit") and
  `:session_not_passed` (an honest "you did not meet the passing score").
  `Letflow.Routers.ExamSessions`' certificate route renders three different
  messages for these three atoms; see that router's own render clause.

  ## Idempotency -- what the source expresses and what this module expresses instead

  Source: `session_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE REFERENCES exam_sessions(id)`
  plus `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (session_id) DO NOTHING`, so two concurrent
  `GetOrCreate` calls for the same session race safely at the database and
  the loser's insert is silently absorbed, both callers ending up with the
  identical row.

  This document's own entity definition
  (`priv/packs/bilimbaga/entity_definitions/certificate.json`) deliberately
  declares NO `constraints` entry for `session_id`, even though
  `Letflow.Entities.Definition`'s `constraint_def` type could express a
  `:unique` constraint over `["session_id"]` -- because ISS-0648 wired
  `constraints` to trigger AUTOMATIC column promotion at definition
  activation (a real per-entity-type SQL table plus a real Postgres
  `UNIQUE` constraint on a promoted column, the mechanism
  `session_question`/`session_answer`/`session_question_score`'s own
  natural-key constraints already ride). That machinery is heavier than
  this record shape needs, and reaching for it here would silently
  pre-answer the very question this requirement's own flagged REVIEWER
  rule-2 sign-off exists to ask ("why is this not simply bucket A pack
  content plus the existing write surface").

  **What is actually used instead**: `issue_or_get_for_user/3` calls
  `Letflow.Entities.Records.create_record/2` with a DETERMINISTIC
  `idempotency_key` -- `"certificate:issue:" <> session_id` -- rather than
  the fresh `Ecto.UUID.generate()` every OTHER write in this vertical
  (`Letflow.Exam.Session`'s own `write_record/4`) uses for its one-time
  writes. `Letflow.EventStore`'s own idempotency mechanism
  (`claim_idempotency/3`, `lib/letflow/event_store.ex:641-691`) is a REAL,
  ALREADY-UNIQUE-INDEXED Postgres constraint (`uq_event_idempotency_key`
  on `event_idempotency`, `priv/repo/migrations/20260816120006_create_event_idempotency.exs`)
  that every entity-record write in this codebase already goes through --
  not a new mechanism authored for this requirement. Two concurrent (or
  sequential) `issue_or_get_for_user/3` calls for the SAME `session_id`
  derive the SAME idempotency key, so the second caller's insert attempt is
  caught by that real unique index (`on_conflict: :nothing, conflict_target:
  :idempotency_key`), and `Letflow.Entities.Records.create_record/2`'s own
  documented AC3 behaviour (`{:ok, %{record: ..., is_duplicate: true}}`,
  decoded from the ORIGINAL creating event's own stored payload, never a
  fresh `entity_record_latest` re-`SELECT`) hands back the identical
  original row both times, with no read-then-write race at any point --
  the DB uniqueness check and the row creation are the SAME atomic insert
  attempt, exactly like the source's `ON CONFLICT (session_id) DO NOTHING`.

  **Guarantee level, stated precisely**: this is not literally
  `UNIQUE (session_id)` at the storage layer the way the source's column
  is -- two DIFFERENT idempotency keys could in principle collide with two
  DIFFERENT `session_id` values if this module's own key derivation were
  ever changed inconsistently, which a real `UNIQUE (session_id)` column
  could not permit even under a bug. What is guaranteed, unconditionally,
  by the real unique index on `idempotency_key`: for THIS module's own
  fixed `"certificate:issue:" <> session_id` derivation, at most one
  certificate row is ever created per `session_id`, atomically, under any
  concurrency -- the exact practical outcome the source's schema-level
  constraint exists to provide.

  ## Branding snapshot -- read once, stored forever (source AC-9)

  `capture_branding_snapshot/1` reads `lib/letflow/routers/tenant_config.ex`'s
  `branding_from_settings/1` (made `def`, was `defp`, by this requirement --
  see that module's own `@doc` on the function) against the tenant's live
  `Tenant.settings`, but ONLY inside `issue_or_get_for_user/3`'s create path
  -- i.e. only the FIRST time a certificate is issued for a session. Every
  subsequent call for the same session returns the idempotent-replay row
  (previous section) without ever calling `branding_from_settings/1` again,
  so a branding change made after issuance is invisible to an
  already-issued certificate's `branding_snapshot` field, matching the
  source's own `TemplateSnapshot` comment ("captures tenant branding at the
  time of first certificate issuance ... so later branding changes do not
  alter existing certificates"). Proven by
  `test/letflow/exam/certificate_test.exs`'s branding-mutation test.

  ## Scope fence (REQ-355's own, restated here)

  This module does NOT render a PDF and does NOT encode a QR code
  (REQ-356) -- no `verification_code` field exists on this entity type at
  all. It issues (or re-fetches) one declarative record; nothing here
  reads or writes `mix.exs`.

  ## `first_issuance`/`public_read_resource_id` (REQ-357)

  `issue_or_fetch/4` now threads `Letflow.Entities.Records.create_record/2`'s
  own `is_duplicate` flag through as `first_issuance` (`not is_duplicate`)
  instead of discarding it, and `certificate_view/2` carries it plus
  `public_read_resource_id` (the record's own `id` -- the Ecto primary key,
  NOT `record_id`) so `Letflow.Routers.ExamSessions` can mint a
  `Letflow.PublicRead` handle exactly once per certificate, on first
  issuance only. Both fields are internal wiring, never part of the
  authenticated JSON response -- see
  `lib/letflow/design/req357-certificate-public-projection.md` §5.
