  One-time data-copy mechanism for Decision 0006 D1
  (`docs/migration/decisions/0006-identity-tables-schema-per-tenant.md`) section 4
  step 3: moves every tenant's `users`/`groups`/`tenant_role` rows out of the
  legacy public tables into that tenant's own already-provisioned Postgres schema.

  Backs `mix letflow.copy_identity_tables` (`Mix.Tasks.Letflow.CopyIdentityTables`)
  — the real logic lives here, not in the Mix task itself, so it is unit-testable
  without going through `Mix.Task.run/1`, matching this project's convention of
  keeping task plumbing thin.

  **Not a migration.** This is an application-level, operator-invoked cutover
  action (reads `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.Registration` and issues normal
  `Repo`/`Ecto.Schema` calls), not a schema change — see
  `lib/letflow/design/req063-identity-tables-schema-per-tenant.md` section 4 for
  the full reasoning this module implements. Must run after the three per-tenant
  `create table` migrations
  (`priv/repo/migrations/20260819000001/2/3_..._tenant_scoped.exs`) have been
  replayed across every tenant schema, and before
  `20260819000004_drop_legacy_public_identity_tables.exs` runs.

  **Idempotent** — every insert uses `on_conflict: :nothing` +
  `conflict_target: :id`, so re-running after a partial failure silently skips
  already-copied rows, matching the `on_conflict: :nothing` idiom this codebase
  already uses in `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.insert_or_fetch_registration/2` and
  `Letflow.Identity.insert_or_fetch/4`.

  Copies one tenant's `users`/`groups`/`tenant_role` rows into `schema_name`.
  Order: `groups` before `tenant_role` (matches the manifest's own FK-driven
  ordering in `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.tenant_scoped_migrations/0` —
  `tenant_role.group_id` must resolve inside the destination schema). `id` is
  preserved verbatim on every insert (client-generated `binary_id`) so any other
  public-schema data still holding a reference to that row's id by value
  continues to resolve correctly during the transition window.

  `tenant_role` carries no `tenant_id` column, so its rows are selected by
  joining through `groups` (whose `tenant_id` is known) via `group_id`. A
  `tenant_role` row whose `group_id` does not resolve to any `groups` row (an
  orphan — should not exist given the FK constraint on the current public
  schema, but is not silently dropped if one somehow does) aborts this tenant's
  transaction as `{:error, {:orphaned_tenant_role, tenant_role_id}}`.
