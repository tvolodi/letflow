defmodule Letflow.Modules.Exam.Session do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-332 -- live exam-session runtime: start, autosave, submit, and the
  system-triggered auto-finalize path. Ported from
  `backend/internal/sessions/service.go`'s `CreateSession`/`SaveAnswer`/
  `SubmitSession` (FR-BB35/FR-BB37/FR-BB39, roadmap 3.5/3.7/3.9). Authorized
  by `lib/letflow/design/req330-exam-live-session.md` §7's rule-2 module
  table, `Letflow.Modules.Exam.Session` row -- read that document in full before
  changing this module's responsibilities.

  ## Rule-2 justification (verbatim from the design doc's table, REQ-330/0022 rule 2)

  **Why not A (a definition).** Orchestrates a stateful, multi-step write
  sequence (eligibility checks in a fixed order, seeded materialization,
  ownership-checked autosave/submit) with server-authoritative deadline
  comparison against wall-clock time -- an entity definition has no
  execution semantics and cannot run a multi-step `with`-chain or compare
  against `DateTime.utc_now()`.

  **Why not B (a generic platform capability).** The eligibility rule set
  (assignment, exam-active/archived, availability window, attempt limits,
  one-open-session) and the ownership/deadline guards are all specific to
  this vertical's session-lifecycle vocabulary (0022 rule 1); nothing
  outside this vertical shares this exact rule set today.

  ## NO per-session process or process-lookup table (REQ-045/decision 0022, non-negotiable)

  This module deliberately names none of the three forbidden mechanisms
  literally in its own source, so that a `grep` for them across
  `lib/letflow/exam/` (REQ-332's own acceptance criterion) returns zero
  hits, including in prose -- not just zero real usages.

  This is a plain module with ordinary functions over `Letflow.Entities.Records`/
  `Letflow.Entities.Query`, exactly like `Letflow.Engine`'s own
  "Process-vs-row decision." Concurrency at `submit/3`/`finalize_expired/3`
  (via `lock_session_row/2`) and at `create/3` (via `lock_exam_row/2`) is
  arbitrated by a real Postgres row lock (`lock("FOR UPDATE")`, the same
  idiom `lib/letflow/event_store.ex`'s `lock_and_increment_sequence/3`
  already uses), never by an in-memory process. See `create_with_seed/4`'s
  own comment for why `create/3`'s lock is taken on the `exam` row rather
  than a `session` row.

  ## Data lives in bucket A -- no migration, no Ecto schema here

  Every read and write goes through `Letflow.Entities.Records`
  (create/update) and `Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler` +
  `Letflow.Entities.Record.Latest` (read). `session`, `session_question`,
  `session_answer` and `session_question_score` (REQ-329) are the only
  entity types this module writes; `exam`, `question` and `answer_option`
  (P1) are read-only inputs.

  ## Autosave write path -- REQ-330's own conclusion, implemented exactly

  Decision `0030`/the design doc §3 measured autosave cost and concluded:
  **"Autosave is implemented via the ORDINARY `Letflow.Entities.Records`/
  `Letflow.Entities.Query` write path, with no fast path, no second write
  mechanism, and no new bucket-B capability built or required."**
  `autosave_answer/4`'s `upsert_answer/5` below does exactly that: an
  ordinary `Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler` read to find any existing
  `session_answer` row for `(session_id, question_id)`, then an ordinary
  `Letflow.Entities.Records.update_record/2` or `create_record/2` -- no
  fast path, no second write mechanism.

  ## FINDING -- the "assignment" eligibility check cannot be truthfully implemented

  REQ-332's eligibility pipeline is ported from `service.go`'s
  `CreateSession`, whose first check is that the candidate is *assigned* to
  the exam. **No `exam_assignment` entity exists anywhere in this tenant's
  schema.**
  `priv/packs/bilimbaga/entity_definitions/README-constraints.md`'s "Group
  (iii)" section records this explicitly as an **open question**, not
  resolved by any requirement landed to date (REQ-327 declined to author
  it; three candidate shapes are named -- an unenforced polymorphic
  reference, a process-definition concern, or something else -- with no
  decision made). `lib/letflow/design/req330-exam-live-session.md` inherits
  `:not_assigned` into `eligibility_error()`'s type but specifies no
  mechanism for it either.

  Per this requirement's own instruction to STOP and report a genuine
  blocker rather than invent a workaround: authoring a new entity
  definition here would be out of `ELIXIR-DEV`'s/this requirement's scope
  (REQ-ANALYST's job, and it would silently resolve an explicitly-deferred
  design question), so `check_assigned/3` below is a **documented no-op** --
  every candidate is currently treated as assigned. `:not_assigned` remains
  declared in `eligibility_error()` for interface-shape fidelity with the
  design doc, but is **unreachable** in this implementation. Flagged
  prominently here and in REQ-332's close-out for ORCH/REQ-ANALYST
  follow-up before this check can be truthfully enforced.

  ## A second, narrower flagged gap -- `submission_outcome()`'s raw sums on the idempotent-replay path

  The `session` entity (REQ-329) persists only `score_pct` and `passed`,
  not the raw `sum(score)`/`sum(max_score)` `score_session/3` computes.
  When `submit/3`/`get_session_for_user/3` return the **recorded** outcome
  of an already-submitted session (the idempotent path), `total_score`/
  `total_max_score` are reconstructed as `percentage`/`100.0` rather than
  the original raw sums, which are not persisted anywhere. This is a
  precision-preserving approximation, not a bug: `percentage` and `passed`
  -- the two fields REQ-332's own acceptance criteria and REQ-331's sweep
  actually consume -- are exact.

  ## Certificate issuance -- explicitly out of scope

  No certificate module, no PDF/QR dependency, no placeholder. See
  `mix.exs`'s unchanged dependency list.

  ## REQ-335 addition -- `get_session_state_for_user/3`

  REQ-335 (the HTTP route surface REQ-332/REQ-333 left unbuilt) added this
  one read-composition function so `Letflow.Modules.Exam.Router`' session-
  state route stays a thin composition layer with no execution semantics of
  its own, matching that requirement's own scope note. No new bucket-C
  reasoning is added by it -- it reuses this module's own private
  `query_all/3`/`fv/2`/`question_type_atom/1` helpers and adds no new
  eligibility rule, write path, or state transition. See that function's own
  `@doc` for the redaction decision it implements.

  # a session row (no `session` row exists yet at create-time to lock: that

  # (`query_all("session", ...)` below) is guaranteed to observe the first
  # call's write before deciding -- closing the race REVIEWER identified
  # (both callers reading zero sessions before either wrote one). This is
  # intentionally coarser-grained than a per-`(candidate_id, exam_id)` lock
  # (it serializes *all* candidates starting the same exam concurrently, not
  # just the same candidate racing themselves) because no
  # per-`(candidate_id, exam_id)` row/unique-constraint exists in the schema

  REQ-335 -- `Letflow.Modules.Exam.Router`' session-state read route calls
  this, not `get_session_for_user/3` alone, because a candidate resuming a
  session needs the materialised question set to render it, not just the
  session envelope. Ownership is delegated entirely to
  `get_session_for_user/3` (same `:session_not_found`/`:not_owner` errors,
  same 404-not-403 shape).

  ## REQ-335's own redaction decision, implemented here (not via FieldGrants)

  Every question/option field is HAND-SELECTED, never delegated to a generic
  entity-record serializer: `question_state/0` carries only `question_id`,
  `sort_order`, `type` and `stem` from `question` (never `explanation`,
  which narrates the correct answer, nor `difficulty`/`category_id`/
  `status`/`version`, which add nothing a candidate needs); each option
  carries only `id` and `text` from `answer_option` (never `is_correct`,
  `likert_weight` or `likert_polarity`). `Letflow.Entities.Query.FieldGrants`
  (REQ-231) was considered and rejected for this route: it redacts fields
  within ONE `Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler` result page for ONE entity
  type, but this response is a hand-composed view joining four entity types
  (`session`, `session_question`, `question`, `answer_option`,
  `session_answer`) with no single query result for a `FieldGrants` call to
  redact. Hand-selecting fields makes leaking `is_correct` a compile-time-
  visible omission rather than a runtime configuration dependency.

  ISS-0647 (SECURITY-REVIEWER): this hand-redaction only ever protected
  THIS route. `TASK_WORKER` -- the role REQ-335 grants every exam-session
  permission to -- already held `:EntitiesQuery`/`:EntitiesAggregate`
  before REQ-335 existed, and until ISS-0647's fix, this pack configured
  no `entity_field_restrictions` row for `is_correct`/`likert_weight`/
  `likert_polarity`/`explanation` at all -- so a candidate could read every
  one of them in clear via the GENERIC `POST /entities/query` route
  directly against `question`/`answer_option`, entirely bypassing this
  function's own careful field selection. `Letflow.Packs.Bilimbaga.
  seed_answer_key_field_restrictions!/1` now seeds exactly those four
  `entity_field_restrictions` rows wherever this pack's real entity
  definitions are provisioned, closing that second path — see that
  module's moduledoc for the full account. This function's own
  hand-selection is left unchanged and stays defense-in-depth; it was
  never the vulnerable half.

  # ISS-0648 companion finding (beyond the design doc's own §2.2.1 scope,
  # empirically discovered while proving acceptance criterion 12): once an
  # entity type is promoted to a real per-entity-type table,
  # `Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler`'s `select_entity_row/1` returns
  # `record_id` as the RAW 16-byte UUID binary Postgrex hands back for an
  # untyped schemaless `select` -- never cast to the hyphenated string form
  # `Compiler.entity_row()`'s own `@type` already promises
  # (`record_id: String.t()`). `upsert_answer/5` below passes an existing
  # `session_answer` row's `record_id` (session_answer is one of this fix's
  # own §4 blast-radius entity types) straight into
  # `Records.update_record/2`, which later fails encoding it as JSON for the
  # event payload -- confirmed empirically:
  # `test/letflow/exam/session_test.exs`'s "a second save on the same
  # question upserts, not duplicates" test raised `Jason.EncodeError`
  # against exactly this raw binary once session_answer started being
  # promoted (this fix's own trigger). This is NOT a new mechanism: it is
  # the identical normalization `lib/letflow/routers/entities.ex`'s own
  # `normalise_record_id/1` already applies for exactly this reason
  # (REQ-300/ISS-0600) -- reused here rather than re-invented.
