defmodule Letflow.Plugs.Admission do
  @moduledoc """
  HTTP wiring for `Letflow.Admission` (REQ-216, closes ISS-0431/GH#835's PRIMARY
  surface, REQ-217). One parameterized `@behaviour Plug` module, mounted TWICE in
  `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline`'s chain with different `:pool` mount options — see
  design `lib/letflow/design/req217-http-admission-wiring.md` for the full
  rationale; this moduledoc restates only what a caller or future maintainer needs.

  ## Two gates, one module

    * `pool: :global` — mounted as the very FIRST plug in `ApiPipeline`, before
      `Plug.Parsers`. Calls `Letflow.Admission.try_acquire(:global)`. No
      `conn.assigns` read.
    * `pool: :tenant` — mounted immediately after `Letflow.Plugs.AuthPipeline` and
      before `Letflow.Plugs.TenantStatus`. Reads `conn.assigns.auth_context.tenant_id`
      (guaranteed present at this mount point — `AuthPipeline` always assigns it or
      halts first) and resolves it to a schema name via the SAME
      `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.schema_name_for_tenant/1` call `AuthPipeline` itself
      already makes — never re-derived independently. Calls
      `Letflow.Admission.try_acquire({:tenant, schema_name})`.

  **Disclosed limitation:** `AuthPipeline`'s own DB work (bearer-token verification,
  tenant-by-realm/slug resolution, JIT provisioning) is covered only by the GLOBAL
  gate, never a per-tenant one, because tenant identity does not exist yet at the
  point in the chain where `AuthPipeline` runs. This is an accepted, disclosed
  limitation of this requirement's scope, not an oversight — closing it would require
  tenant identity earlier in the chain than this codebase currently resolves it.

  ## `Retry-After` — 1 second, not `TenantStatus`'s 30

  `Letflow.Admission.try_acquire/2` is a single synchronous `GenServer.call/2`
  against in-memory counters with **no wait queue at all** — a rejected caller's
  slot can free up as soon as any other in-flight request's `release/2` runs, which
  for this codebase's request shapes is expected to be low hundreds of milliseconds
  at worst. `Letflow.Plugs.TenantStatus`'s `@retry_after_seconds "30"` is right for
  ITS OWN, structurally different case — a migration-in-progress wait that can
  genuinely take tens of seconds — and is deliberately NOT copied uncritically here.
  Retrying after 1s is far more likely to succeed than waiting 30s, and costs the
  client nothing extra if it doesn't (it can be rejected again immediately). The
  value is a fixed, configured constant (`:letflow, :admission, :retry_after_seconds`,
  default 1) — never a computed estimate, since this admission mechanism has no
  queueing/backoff-timing model to derive one from.

  ## Ref storage and release — two independent, non-exclusive mechanisms

  On a successful `try_acquire/2`, the resulting `admission_ref()` is stored TWICE:

    1. On `conn.assigns` (under `:global_admission_ref` or `:tenant_admission_ref`,
       depending on which gate produced it).
    2. Prepended onto a list held under `@admission_refs_pdict_key` in the process
       dictionary of the process handling this request.

  **Mechanism A — `Plug.Conn.register_before_send/2`** — covers every
  NON-crashing response path (normal completion, a later plug's own halt+response,
  a route handler's ordinary error response). Releases this gate's own
  `conn.assigns` ref if still present, and ALSO clears the process-dictionary key
  entirely (idempotent hygiene: `Letflow.Admission.release/2` is documented
  idempotent, so it does not matter which of Mechanism A's two registered callbacks
  — one per gate — clears the pdict key first, or whether Mechanism B has already
  drained it via a crash on an earlier attempt on a keep-alive-reused process).

  **Mechanism B — `Plug.ErrorHandler` on `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline` (this
  module's `handle_errors/2` callback)** — covers the raise sites Mechanism A
  cannot reach. `register_before_send/2` callbacks are skipped entirely on any
  `catch`/`rescue` in Bandit's own request pipeline, for ANY raise regardless of
  where it originates. Whether `conn.assigns` would even be a reliable read
  channel if something else tried to clean up depends on WHERE the raise
  happened:

    * A raise inside the MATCHED ROUTE HANDLER (during `:dispatch`, after
      `:match`) is wrapped by `Plug.Router`'s own `dispatch/2` into a
      `Plug.Conn.WrapperError` carrying the fully-downstream conn — `conn.assigns`
      IS reliable there, but `register_before_send/2` still never runs on this
      path (Bandit skips it unconditionally on any raise), so a conn-based read
      inside `handle_errors/2` is still needed.
    * A raise inside a PLUG that runs BEFORE `dispatch/2` — `AuthPipeline`,
      `TenantStatus`, or this module's own believed-unreachable branches below —
      is NOT wrapped in `Plug.Conn.WrapperError` at all (`Plug.Builder`'s
      generated pre-dispatch pipeline body has no per-plug `try/catch` of its
      own) and surfaces via `Plug.ErrorHandler`'s plain `catch` clause with the
      PRE-PIPELINE conn — a conn on which NEITHER admission-ref assign is
      visible, since each `assign/3` call happened on a locally-rebound `conn`
      variable inside `Plug.Builder`'s generated function body, invisible to
      `call/2`'s separately-bound outer parameter.

  This is why the process dictionary (process-local, unaffected by which `conn`
  binding is in scope, or by exception unwinding of the conn's own call stack) is
  the single mechanism `handle_errors/2` reads from — it works uniformly for both
  raise sites above, unlike `conn.assigns` which is only reliable for the first.
  This is this requirement's most safety-critical property: the process-dictionary
  mechanism exists specifically for a raise inside a PRE-dispatch plug, not because
  nothing in this codebase's stack ever wraps a raise in `Plug.Conn.WrapperError`
  (it does, for the route-handler case — see above).

  ## Tenant-derivation-failure branches — deliberately undefended

  `{:error, :invalid_tenant_id}` from `schema_name_for_tenant/1`, and a missing
  `:auth_context` assign, are both believed unreachable in practice (this plug is
  only ever mounted after `AuthPipeline` in `ApiPipeline`'s fixed chain, and
  `AuthPipeline` itself would already have failed before assigning `:auth_context`
  for any `tenant_id` `schema_name_for_tenant/1` would reject). Both are left to
  crash rather than defended against with a fallback response — matching
  `TenantStatus`'s own fail-closed precedent for a comparably "should not occur"
  case (`tenant_status.ex:70-74`). A violation of the stated invariant is loud (a
  500 + logged crash, cleaned up via Mechanism B above) rather than silently
  admitting or silently rejecting every request.
