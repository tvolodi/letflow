defmodule Letflow.Plugs.TenantStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  Tenant status gate — two independent, linearly-composed checks over the
  same tenant lookup.

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  1. **Deactivation check (REQ-075, all methods).** A request against a
     tenant whose `status` is `:inactive`, from a caller whose roles
     (`conn.assigns.auth_context.roles`) do not include `"PLATFORM_ADMIN"`,
     is rejected with `403` and body `{"error": "tenant_inactive", "detail":
     "tenant is deactivated"}` (no `Retry-After` header — that header is
     specific to check 2 below). Runs for **every** HTTP method, including
     `GET`/`HEAD`, matching R-Co's `enforceTenantActiveForOperation`/
     `isTenantInactive` (`src/identity/service.zig:133-151`,
     `src/api/middleware/auth.zig:1663-1674`). PLATFORM_ADMIN callers are
     exempt. Authorized exactly in this shape by REVIEWER — see
     `docs/migration/stage-4-api-surface.md`'s 2026-08-22 (REQ-075) sign-off
     entry; do not narrow to write-only or widen the exemption without a
     fresh sign-off.

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  2. **Write-pause check (REQ-021, ports `src/api/middleware/tenant_status.zig`'s
     `checkTenantWritePause/4`), unchanged.** A write request
     (`POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`) against a tenant whose `status` is
     `:migrating` is rejected with `503` and a `Retry-After` header.
     `GET`/`HEAD` (and any other non-write method) pass through this second
     check unchanged. No PLATFORM_ADMIN exemption on this check: an
     in-progress migration is a data-integrity window, not an authorization
     decision, so no role overrides it (unlike check 1's deactivation gate
     above, which is a policy/authorization decision PLATFORM_ADMIN can
     legitimately override).

  Both checks reuse the **same** `Repo.get(Tenant, tenant_id)` lookup — one
  query per request, not two. Call this **after** `Letflow.Plugs.AuthPipeline`
  has resolved `conn.assigns[:auth_context][:tenant_id]` (and `:roles`), and
  before dispatching to any sub-router.

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  **Fail-closed on a genuine DB error during the tenant-status lookup** — a
  deliberate divergence from `tenant_status.zig`'s own fail-open behavior
  (pool exhaustion / query failure both let the request through in R-Co).
  This plug instead lets a lookup failure propagate as a crash of the
  handling process (letting the existing OTP/Bandit request-handling
  isolation apply) rather than silently bypassing a data-integrity
  safeguard. See `lib/letflow/design/req021-auth-plug-pipeline.md` §6.4
  (OQ-14) — the design states this as a recommendation, not a mandate;
  REVIEWER has confirmed this holds for the REQ-075 check too (INV-8 does
  not favor a narrower/isolated alternative — see the sign-off entry above).

  **Mounted since REQ-071**, immediately after `Letflow.Plugs.AuthPipeline` in
  `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline`'s plug chain, matching this module's own calling
  convention above — every `/api/v1/*` request has `conn.assigns[:auth_context]`
  populated by `AuthPipeline` before this plug runs.
