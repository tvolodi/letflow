defmodule Letflow.Repository.Attachments do
  @moduledoc """
  Context module for the `instance_attachments` table's core lifecycle:
  `upload/2`, `list/2`, `get/2`, `delete/2`. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req211-instance-attachments-core.md` for the full
  design this module implements. Plain Ecto context module, no process --
  same shape as `Letflow.Dlq`/`Letflow.Webhooks`.

  **Scope boundary (design §4.0 item 1):** this module covers only the
  `instance_attachments` schema/migration and these four functions. No
  route, no controller, no Plug module -- that is REQ-212.

  ## Tenant scoping (INV-1, design §4.0 item 2)

  Every function below takes `opts :: [prefix: String.t()]`, `prefix` always
  supplied by the caller -- this module never itself decides tenant scope,
  matching every REQ-072+ context module's own precedent
  (`Letflow.Dlq`/`Letflow.Webhooks`). `tenant_id` is never accepted from
  caller-supplied attrs -- it is always derived from `opts[:prefix]` via
  `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.tenant_id_for_schema_name/1`.

  ## INV-a -- `content_type` is caller-supplied metadata, never a validated
  ## fact (design §4.0 item 3)

  Nothing in this module, and nothing any caller of this module may assume,
  treats the stored `content_type` value as verified against the actual byte
  content -- no magic-byte/MIME-sniffing check is performed anywhere here. A
  caller declaring `content_type: "application/pdf"` for a file that is not
  actually a PDF is accepted and stored exactly as declared. Any future
  consumer that needs a *trusted* content-type determination must not read
  this field as if it were one.

  ## INV-b -- `byte_size` is independently measured, never caller-trusted
  ## (design §4.0 item 4)

  `upload/2` computes `byte_size` via `byte_size/1` (Elixir's own function),
  over the actual `raw_bytes` binary parameter -- this computed value is what
  both `repository_artifacts` (if a new row) and `instance_attachments`
  store. `upload_attrs()` has no parameter for a caller-declared size at
  all -- there is structurally nothing to ignore, which is a stronger
  guarantee than "ignores it if present."

  ## Decision B cross-tenant statement (AC8, design §4.0 item 6)

  `repository_artifacts` is per-tenant-schema-scoped (Decision B,
  `docs/migration/decisions/0003-ecto-schema-strategy.md`), so `content_hash`
  dedup happens only within one tenant's own schema. Two different tenants
  uploading byte-identical file content each get their own
  `repository_artifacts` row, in their own Postgres schema -- never one
  shared row. This module deliberately does not, and cannot by construction,
  share content-hash rows across tenants.

  ## No-canonicalisation statement (AC8, design §4.0 item 7)

  No canonicalisation is applied to attachment bytes before hashing --
  byte-identity hashing only, per REQ-202's existing binary-content rule
  (`Letflow.Repository.Canonicaliser`'s byte-identity branch for non-JSON
  content). This applies regardless of an attachment's declared
  `content_type` -- even an attachment declared `application/json` is hashed
  byte-identically here, NOT run through `Letflow.Repository.Canonicaliser`'s
  JSON canonicalization branch, because an attachment is an opaque
  user-uploaded document, not a versioned configuration artifact subject to
  REQ-202's dedup-by-canonical-form semantics.

  ## Content scanning (ISS-0399, `lib/letflow/design/iss0399-attachment-content-scanning.md`)

  `upload/2` runs a synchronous, reject-before-persist content scan (§2)
  before either `repository_artifacts` or `instance_attachments` is written --
  an infected or scan-failed upload is never persisted at all, so there is
  structurally no code path that can serve an unscanned/infected attachment's
  bytes (see `get_content/2`'s own moduledoc for the defense-in-depth gate
  covering pre-existing rows). The scanner adapter is resolved via
  `Application.get_env(:letflow, :attachment_scanner,
  Letflow.Repository.AttachmentScanner.SignatureHeuristic)` -- the same
  safe-default pattern `lib/letflow/engine/lua/platform.ex`'s
  `lua_platform_service_caller` uses -- defaulting in every environment, with
  no config required, to `Letflow.Repository.AttachmentScanner.SignatureHeuristic`,
  a real (if limited) EICAR-signature-based scanner, not a stub. Swapping in a
  real external AV engine later means implementing
  `Letflow.Repository.AttachmentScanner`'s `scan/2` callback in a new module
  and changing that one config value -- no change to this module.

  ## `delete/2`'s metadata-only-delete rationale (design §4.0 item 9)

  `delete/2` removes the `instance_attachments` row only; the underlying
  `repository_artifacts` content row is never deleted by this module, both
  because REQ-202's own immutability rule and `ON DELETE RESTRICT` FK
  already forbid deleting a referenced content row, and because another
  attachment (or a REQ-202 `artifact_versions` row) could independently
  share the same `content_hash`.

  Uploads an attachment: hashes `raw_bytes` independently (byte-identity
  only, no canonicalisation), runs a synchronous content scan (ISS-0399
  design §2), then upserts a `repository_artifacts` row keyed by that hash
  (creating or reusing it, including the real bytes into its `content`
  column), and inserts one `instance_attachments` row referencing it.

  Steps (design §4.1, revised by ISS-0399 design §2):

    1. Computes `byte_size = byte_size(raw_bytes)` -- never a caller-supplied
       field. If it exceeds `#{@max_upload_bytes}` bytes (25 MiB,
       `@max_upload_bytes`), returns `{:error, :file_too_large}`
       immediately, before any hashing, scanning, upsert, or insert is
       attempted -- neither a `repository_artifacts` row nor an
       `instance_attachments` row is created.
    2. Computes `content_hash = :crypto.hash(:sha256, raw_bytes)` --
       byte-identity hashing only, unconditionally, regardless of
       `content_type` (see moduledoc's no-canonicalisation statement).
    3. Calls the configured `Letflow.Repository.AttachmentScanner` adapter
       (moduledoc) synchronously, before any persistence. `{:ok, :infected,
       verdict}` and `{:error, reason}` both **fail closed**: no
       `repository_artifacts` row, no `instance_attachments` row is created,
       and this function returns `{:error, :infected, verdict}` /
       `{:error, :scan_unavailable}` respectively. An infected verdict also
       emits one structured `Logger.warning/2` audit entry (never the raw
       bytes) so a rejected upload attempt is not silently invisible to
       operators.
    4. Upserts the `repository_artifacts` row via
       `Letflow.Repository.upsert_content/6`, in the same tenant's schema.
    5. Derives `tenant_id` from `opts[:prefix]`.
    6. Inserts the `instance_attachments` row with `scan_status: :clean` --
       the only value this function ever writes; this insert is unreachable
       unless step 3 returned `{:ok, :clean}`.

  Uploading byte-identical content twice (same or different `instance_id`)
  reuses the same `repository_artifacts` row (step 4's upsert) while step 6
  always inserts a fresh `instance_attachments` row -- so two calls
  necessarily produce one `repository_artifacts` row and two
  `instance_attachments` rows, by construction, not by a special-cased
  check (AC2).

  Tenant-scoped fetch of one attachment's metadata AND its raw byte content

  already documents (metadata via `get/2`'s own query, then a second,
  separate lookup against `repository_artifacts` keyed by the metadata row's
  own `content_hash`, reading its `content` column).

  Added as its own function, rather than left as two separate calls made
  directly by REQ-212's route handler, because `Letflow.Api.AuthorizedRouter`
  -based routers must never issue a `Repo.*` call directly (`INV-RT-1`, this
  codebase's project-wide route-layer boundary enforced by
  `test/letflow/routers/req078_supporting_routes_test.exs`'s
  `T-19` test) -- the same conflict REQ-191/192 already hit and resolved the
  same way (adding the needed read to the context module,
  `Letflow.ServiceCatalog.list_all/1`, rather than querying from the
  router). REQ-212's own design
  (`lib/letflow/design/req212-instance-attachments-routes.md` §4) specified
  the second `Repo.get(Letflow.Repository.Artifact, ...)` call as "this
  route layer's job" without having checked INV-RT-1 against it -- this
  function is that same mechanism, relocated into the context module it
  belongs in per the project's actual, already-enforced convention. Not a
  design change to the mechanism itself, only to which module issues the
  `Repo` call.

  A `nil` second-lookup result is a structural-invariant violation, not a
  normal caller-facing error -- `instance_attachments.content_hash` has a
  `null: false, references(:repository_artifacts, ..., on_delete: :restrict)`
  FK, so a row returned by the first lookup is guaranteed by the database
  itself to have a matching `repository_artifacts` row in the same tenant
  schema. Surfaced as `{:error, :content_missing}` so the caller can map it
  to a 500 (INV-4, no detail) rather than a 404, which would incorrectly
  suggest the attachment itself doesn't exist.

  ## `scan_status` gate (ISS-0399 design §4.2)

  Before bytes are returned, `attachment.scan_status` must be `:clean` -- any
  other value (`:pending`, `:infected`, `:error`) returns
  `{:error, :not_available}` instead, and the `Artifact.content` value is not
  surfaced. `upload/2`'s own reject-before-persist guarantee (moduledoc)
  already makes an `:infected`/`:error` row structurally unreachable via this
  module's own write path, so this gate exists as defense-in-depth for the
  one row shape it *can* still observe: a **pre-existing** row from before
  this scan mechanism shipped, which defaults to `:pending`
  (design §1.1) and has never actually been scanned. `list/2` and `get/2`
  are unaffected by this gate -- a `:pending`/`:infected` row's metadata
  (including `scan_status` itself) still lists/fetches normally; only
  byte-serving is gated, because that is the only path that can leak actual
  file content.
