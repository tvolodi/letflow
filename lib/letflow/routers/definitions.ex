defmodule Letflow.Routers.Definitions do
  @moduledoc """
  Process-definition sub-router, mounted at `/definitions` by
  `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline`.

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  REQ-078 adds **exactly one** route to it — the definition-graph validation
  endpoint. REQ-081 adds the five read routes below. REQ-082 adds the eight
  write/lifecycle routes below that. REQ-077 adds **exactly one** route —
  `POST /:process_key/rollback` (PRM-08, ports
  `src/api/routes/definition_rollback.zig`) — placed here only because
  `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline` forwards `/definitions` here and `Plug.Router`
  permits one forward per prefix (`lib/letflow/design/req077-promotion-pipeline-routes.md`
  §2.3). REQ-081/082 own every other route under `/definitions` and must
  not treat this one route as precedent for their own design, nor remove
  it. Its handler, validation schema and response allowlist are specified
  in that design doc's §7.6. None of the four requirements touches the
  `match _` catch-all or modifies a route another of them added.

  `POST /:process_key/rollback` is declared with a plain `post` macro, not
  `authz_post` — it is `:Unknown`-gated (PLATFORM_ADMIN-only), the same
  deliberate decision every other REQ-077 route makes; see
  `Letflow.Routers.Promotions`' moduledoc for the full reasoning.

  ## REQ-082 — write/lifecycle routes: a permission-gate divergence from R-Co

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  These four routes have no pre-existing permission-gate precedent to
  inherit — confirmed by grepping R-Co's `authorization.zig` for
  `endpoint_policy_key` entries covering deprecate/archive/delete/import,
  zero hits, the same
  "no clause, not permission-gated" shape REQ-078/079 already established
  for rebind-pins/reconstruct. REQ-082's own acceptance criterion 7 ("a
  caller without DefinitionsWrite receives 403 on all eight endpoints") is
  what requires gating these four — see `Letflow.Api.Authorization`'s own
  comment at its four new clauses for the full reasoning.

  ## REQ-081 — read routes (design: `lib/letflow/design/req081-definition-routes-read.md`)

  Five `GET` handlers, all delegating into `Letflow.Definitions`/
  `Letflow.Definitions.ExportImport` (both already shipped, except
  `list_paginated/2`/`search_paginated/3` which REQ-081 adds). Every one is
  wrapped in `with_authorized_scope/4`, copied structurally from
  `Letflow.Routers.Instances`'s own private helper of the same name and
  shape (temporary direct duplication, pending REQ-131's consolidation —
  same precedent, not a shared/imported module).

  ### Route ordering

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  `/active/:name`, `/search`, `/:id/export`, and (REQ-125) `/delta` are
  declared **above** `/:id`, which is declared above `/` (this registration
  order also appears in `main.zig`), for the same
  reason `Letflow.Routers.Instances`'s `/:id/history`-before-`/:id` note
  documents:
  `Plug.Router` is first-match-wins, so a bare `GET "/:id"` declared above any
  of these would swallow it with `id` bound to the literal suffix (`"delta"`
  for `/delta`).

  ## REQ-125 — `GET /definitions/delta` (design: `lib/letflow/design/req125-definitions-delta-sync.md`)

  Delegates to `Letflow.Definitions.delta/2` — see that function's `@doc` and
  this module's own moduledoc addendum for the cursor-semantics reasoning
  (AC2). `since` is read from `conn.query_params["since"]`: absent -> `nil`
  (full history); a decimal-digit string -> the parsed integer;
  present-but-non-numeric -> `{:error, :invalid_since}`, the same 400
  `delta/2`'s own syntactic-validity check (a negative integer) produces.
  Parsing uses `Integer.parse/1` requiring full-string consumption — the same
  idiom `Letflow.Api.Pagination.parse_page_size_param/1` already uses. `items`
  is rendered through the **existing** `definition_map/1` allowlist — no new
  response shape to audit for INV-2, `status` included (AC3: a deprecated or
  archived definition is representable in the delta response by its `status`
  field, no separate tombstone type).

  ### `handle_search`'s three-way HTTP contract (AC2/AC3)

  `Definitions.search_paginated/3` returns `{:error, :query_empty}`/
  `{:error, :query_too_long}` for a validation failure (mapped to **400**,
  matching REQ-081's acceptance criteria text verbatim — both are
  malformed-input errors, not semantic-validation failures, so 400 is the
  correct class for both), and a genuinely-valid,
  zero-match query returns `{:ok, %{items: [], next_cursor: nil}}` (**200**,
  empty array) — never conflated. `render_search_result/1`'s clause list
  keeps these as three separate code paths.

  ### `get_by_id`/`export` inherit `get_by_id/2`'s not-found collapse (OQ-2)

  Neither handler pre-casts `:id` to a UUID the way `Letflow.Routers.Instances`
  does for `instance_id` — `Letflow.Definitions.get_by_id/2` (REQ-030) already
  internally maps a cast failure to `{:error, :not_found}` (its own
  `cast_uuid/1`), so a malformed UUID and a genuinely-absent-but-well-formed
  UUID collapse to the same 404 — the **stronger** INV-5 guarantee, since a
  caller gets no signal distinguishing "malformed" from "absent" either way,
  flagged in the design doc for REVIEWER sign-off rather than silently
  decided.

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  ## Two different R-Co files are called `validation.zig`. They are unrelated.

    PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
    * `src/api/routes/validation.zig` (173 lines) is the **definition-graph
      validation endpoint** — `POST /api/v1/definitions/:id/validate`,
      VLD-01/02/03, which runs validators over a *stored process-definition
      graph*. **That is what is ported here, by REQ-078.**
    PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
    * `src/api/validation.zig` (592 lines) is the **request-body validator** —
      API-07, which checks an *incoming JSON request payload* against a
      field-constraint schema and returns RFC 9457 field errors. It has
      nothing to do with process definitions. **That is ported by REQ-068, as
      `Letflow.Api.Validation` (`lib/letflow/api/validation.ex`).**

  Both appear in this module — the second as the `Letflow.Api.Validation`
  calls that check request bodies, the first as this endpoint's own delegate.
  Do not conflate them, and do not "consolidate" them: they validate different
  things at different layers. `Letflow.Api.Validation`'s own moduledoc carries
  a pointer back to this section, so a reader arriving from either side finds
  the distinction.

  ## The `/validation` sub-router stub was DELETED, not left unused

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  REQ-070 reserved a `Letflow.Routers.Validation` at `/validation`, grouping
  by Zig **filename** (`routes/validation.zig`) rather than by URL. **R-Co has
  no `/validation` URL prefix anywhere**; the real path is
  `POST /api/v1/definitions/:id/validate` (`main.zig:777-784`,
  `validation.zig:6`), which is a `/definitions` route. Since
  `Plug.Router.forward/2` is prefix-exclusive, two sub-routers cannot both own
  `/definitions`, so a `/validation`-mounted module could never carry R-Co's
  real path. The stub's own moduledoc promised "Routes added by REQ-078", so
  leaving it in place unused would have left behind a module documenting a
  promise it did not keep. It and its forward are gone.

  ## The route adds no validation rule of its own (AC4)

  Everything this handler does after casting `:id` is
  `Letflow.Definitions.validate_definition_graph/2`, which runs exactly
  `Graph.validate_graph/1`, `validate_node_attributes/1` and
  `validate_edge_conditions/1` and concatenates their violations in that
  order. The route contains **no** validation logic, so "the endpoint agrees
  with the validators called directly" is structural, not merely tested.

  `Letflow.Definitions.ServiceScopeValidator.validate/3` is **deliberately
  excluded** — it needs an injected `Lookup.t()` this endpoint has no source
  for, and including it would break that equality.
  `Letflow.Definitions.activate/2` remains its owning path.

  ## `"valid"`, not `"semantically_valid"` — a deliberate divergence

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  R-Co emits `"status":"semantically_valid"` plus `"compiler_version"`
  (`validation.zig:115-118`), because its VLD-01/02/03 pipeline performs
  expression type-checking and its VLD-04 gate persists a verdict with a
  compiler version. **Letflow has ported neither.** Claiming
  `"semantically_valid"` would overclaim what was actually checked, and
  `compiler_version` has no value to report. Letflow emits `"valid"` and omits
  `compiler_version`.

  Violations live under a **different key per outcome**, by construction:

  | Outcome | Status | Where violations live |
  |---|---|---|
  | valid   | 200 | `"findings"` — always `[]` |
  | invalid | 422 | `"errors"`, the RFC 9457 extension member |

  A success body is not a problem document and must not carry
  problem-document members.

  ## INV-5 — cross-tenant is 404, and it is the same 404

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  An `:id` belonging to another tenant is invisible in the caller's
  prefix-scoped schema, so `get_by_id/2` returns `{:error, :not_found}` — the
  **same call, same code path, same query count and same response bytes** as a
  genuinely absent id. `Letflow.Api.Response.not_found/1` takes no detail, so
  there is no slot through which the two could differ. This matches
  `validation.zig:31`'s own documented behaviour: "cross-tenant reads fall
  through as `DefinitionNotFound` (HTTP 404)". No handler may add a
  cross-tenant existence check to produce a nicer message.

  ## Authorization gap — REQ-131 closes it

  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  This route does not call `Letflow.Api.Authorization.evaluate_access/2`.
  `endpoint_policy_key/2` has no clause for
  `POST /definitions/:id/validate` — there is no existing policy clause to
  extend (R-Co's `authorization.zig` has no entry for it either, so there
  is no precedent to port from there either), and deciding what permission
  a definition validation requires is a policy question belonging to
  **REQ-130/REQ-131**. Inventing a route-local permission check here was
  explicitly ruled out. The route is authenticated and tenant-scoped but not
  permission-gated; **REQ-131 is the closer.**

  ## Ordering guarantee

  Honours the contract stated in `Letflow.Routers.Tenants`'s moduledoc section
  **"Ordering guarantee (design §6.1)"**: no `Repo` call of any kind happens
  before the scoped prefix has been resolved. Structural here — **this module
  performs no `Repo` call at all**; the one read is inside
  `Letflow.Definitions.validate_definition_graph/2`, whose `opts` argument
  *is* the prefix.
