defmodule Letflow.Routers.Entities do
  @moduledoc """
  Entity-subsystem sub-router, mounted at `/entities` by
  `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline`. Built to
  `lib/letflow/design/req308-entity-http-surface.md` — §1 is the route table,
  §2 settles one-router-not-two, §5 the security posture, §6 pagination, §7
  the error mapping per delegate.

  REQ-310 created this module with the nine definition and record routes
  below; REQ-311 appended §1's tenth row, `POST /entities/query`, to this
  same module — an append, not a restructure. REQ-315 appended an eleventh
  row, `POST /entities/query/aggregate` — the aggregation/reporting query
  route, per `lib/letflow/design/req312-query-aggregation.md`. Its handler
  calls `Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler.run_aggregate/2`, a thin wrapper
  around `compile_aggregate/2` plus the query's own execution, added
  specifically so this route stays composition-only, same as every other
  route here — this module executes no query of its own (INV-1, below).
  REQ-317 appended a twelfth-through-fifteenth set of rows, the four
  record-attachment routes, per
  `lib/letflow/design/req313-entity-record-attachments.md` §3 — delegating
  to `Letflow.Repository.EntityAttachments` (REQ-316), mirroring
  `Letflow.Routers.Instances`' own REQ-212 instance-attachment routes.

  Its permission vocabulary (`:EntitiesDefinitionsRead`,
  `:EntitiesDefinitionsWrite`, `:EntitiesRecordsWrite`, and REQ-311's
  `:EntitiesQuery`) was minted ahead of this router by REQ-309 — every route
  below resolves through a real `Letflow.Api.Authorization.endpoint_policy_key/2`
  clause, so none is on `test/letflow/api/authorization_enforcement_test.exs`'s
  allowlist and none evaluates as `:Unknown`.

  REQ-319 appends a twelfth row, `POST /entities/records/:entity_type/export`
  — bulk, query-selected-set record export, per
  `lib/letflow/design/req314-entity-record-bulk-export-import.md` (built to
  that document's final, SECURITY-REVIEWER-cleared §6 INV-2 mechanism, not its
  original FAILed pass). Its route-level permission, `:EntitiesRecordsExport`,
  and its in-handler-only escalation permission,
  `:EntitiesRecordsExportUnredacted`, were both minted ahead of this router by
  REQ-318, the same "added ahead of its consuming route" state REQ-309's own
  four `Entities*` atoms sat in before REQ-310 created this module.

  ## `POST .../export`'s two-tier redaction mechanism (REQ-319, design §6 INV-2)

  Default mode (`unredacted` absent or `false` in the request body): the
  route-level `:EntitiesRecordsExport` check is the ONLY check. The handler
  then calls `FieldGrants.load_restrictions/3` and redacts exactly as `query`
  above does — this route's own `redact/4` clauses are reused verbatim, not
  duplicated — so default-mode export's disclosure strength is identical to
  `:EntitiesQuery`'s.

  Escalated mode (`unredacted: true`): AFTER the route-level check already
  passed, the handler calls `Letflow.Api.Authorization.evaluate_access/2` a
  SECOND time, positionally, against `:EntitiesRecordsExportUnredacted`
  directly — a request-body-derived permission check no route's
  `endpoint_policy_key/2` clause could ever express, since it depends on a
  field inside the body, not the method/path pair. Failing that check is a
  `403` returned **before the export selection query is even compiled** —
  never a silent fallback to the redacted default. Succeeding it skips
  `FieldGrants` entirely for that call. See `check_unredacted_permission/2`
  and `run_export/5` below for the concrete `with`-chain ordering.

  ## Route ordering — load-bearing, not cosmetic (design §1)

  `Plug.Router` is first-match-wins. `GET /definitions/active/:name` and
  `GET /definitions/by-name/:name` are declared **above**
  `GET /definitions/:id`. Declared below it, the bare `:id` route would match
  first with `id` bound to the literal string `"active"`/`"by-name"`, the
  intended handler never reached, and the request would 404 from a
  non-existent-UUID lookup — with no compile error and no warning anywhere.
  Same hazard class `Letflow.Routers.Definitions`' own moduledoc documents for
  its `/active/:name`/`/search`/`/delta` routes.

  `POST /definitions/:name/activate` is a three-segment path that cannot
  compete with the one-segment `POST /definitions`, and GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
  are independent dispatch tables in `Plug.Router` (so the `/definitions/...`
  GETs never compete with the `/records/...` writes) — but the activate route
  is still declared above `POST /definitions` for readability, matching
  `Letflow.Routers.Definitions`' own precedent.

  ## No route reads a record by id, and none lists records (design §1)

  `Letflow.Entities.Records` is a command-only context module —
  `create_record/2`, `update_record/2`, `delete_record/2` and **no read
  function**. Record reads are exclusively `POST /entities/query`
  (REQ-311); there is deliberately no `GET /entities/records/...` route here
  and no read function was added to `Letflow.Entities.Records` to support one.

  ## INV-1 — the only source of prefix is `conn.assigns.scoped_opts`

  No route below accepts a caller-supplied tenant id, schema name, or slug in
  its path, query string, or body. Every delegate's `prefix` comes from
  `conn.assigns.scoped_opts` (`Letflow.Api.Context.scoped_repo_opts/1`'s
  output, resolved by `Letflow.Plugs.Authorize` from the authenticated
  caller's own token), exactly as `Letflow.Routers.Definitions` and
  `Letflow.Routers.Instances` already do. An actor id comes from
  `conn.assigns.auth_context.user_id`, never from a body or query field.
  This module performs **no `Repo` call of any kind** — every read and write
  happens inside a context module.

  ## INV-2 — `POST /query` redacts on BOTH branches, by two different calls

  Redaction happens before `Letflow.Api.Response.ok/2` ever serialises a
  page, and which redactor runs is decided by `request.join` — the SAME
  field `Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler.compile/2` itself branches on to
  pick `compile_plain` vs `compile_joined`. Branching on the same input
  makes it structurally impossible for the redactor to disagree with the
  row shape it is redacting.

    * **join-bearing** (`join: [_ | _]`) →
      `Letflow.Entities.Query.FieldGrants.redact_joined_page/2`, given a
      `restriction_sets()` map built from ONE
      `FieldGrants.load_restrictions/3` call per EXPOSED entity type:
      `:primary` for the primary's own type, plus each
      `join_clause().entity_type` keyed by that string. A `through`
      entity's type is deliberately NOT among them — its row is never
      exposed in a `Compiler.joined_row()` (that type's own typedoc), so
      no key of a joined row could ever be looked up against it.
    * **non-join** → `Letflow.Entities.Query.FieldGrants.redact_page/2`,
      given the ONE `restriction_set()` for `request.entity_type`.

  Both branches now call `FieldGrants` directly, and neither redacts
  anything here in the router. ⛔ Keep it that way: a redaction policy
  (what counts as restricted, what the sentinel is) belongs to
  `FieldGrants` alone, and a second copy in a router is how the two
  drift apart.

  ### Build record — the ISS-0600 detour, now closed

  REQ-311 shipped the non-join branch against a router-local
  `redact_plain_page/2` instead, because `FieldGrants.redact_page/2`'s
  private `redact_item/2` matched `%Letflow.Entities.Record.Latest{}`
  only, while `Compiler.compile_plain/5` emits a plain
  `Compiler.entity_row()` MAP whenever the entity type has a promoted
  per-entity-type table — so `redact_page/2` raised `FunctionClauseError`
  on exactly the rows a promoted type produces, surfacing through this
  route as a 500 on a read that must instead be redacted. This route was
  the first caller to reach that gap. REQ-311's scope fence forbade
  touching `lib/letflow/entities/`, so the shape adapter lived here and
  the real gap was filed as **ISS-0600**
  (`docs/issues/ISS-0600.yaml`) against `FieldGrants` itself; both gates
  made filing it a condition of their PASS. ISS-0600's fix has since
  landed: `redact_item/2` now carries a second clause,
  `%{field_values: _} when is_map(item)`, so `redact_page/2` handles both
  row shapes natively. The adapter was deleted and this branch points at
  `redact_page/2` again — same redaction outcome on both shapes, one
  policy owner.

  ## INV-5 — not-found and cross-tenant are the same bytes

  `{:error, :not_found}` from the three definition getters and
  `{:error, {:definition_not_found, _}}`/`{:error, {:record_not_found, _}}`
  from `Letflow.Entities.Records` all fold to `Letflow.Api.Response.not_found/1`,
  which takes no detail — so there is no slot through which a cross-tenant
  probe and a genuinely-absent id could differ. They are the same call on the
  same code path: the prefix-scoped lookup makes another tenant's row
  structurally invisible. **No handler adds a cross-tenant existence
  pre-check** to produce a nicer or more specific message — that would
  reintroduce exactly the "exists but forbidden" signal INV-5 forbids.

  ## INV-8 — every error union is mapped exhaustively

  Each delegate's error union is mapped per design §7, each with a catch-all
  `term() -> 500` clause via `Letflow.Api.Response.internal_error/1` (which
  takes no detail, per INV-4). `:invalid_schema_name` and
  `:tenant_not_provisioned` are unreachable through this router (INV-1 makes
  `prefix` server-resolved only) but are mapped for completeness, the same
  "unreachable but mapped" discipline every other router here already uses.
  `:empty_group`, `:duplicate_artifact_in_group` and
  `{:payload_validation_failed, _}` are unreachable for their own separate
  reasons, each stated at its own clause.

  **No handler catches an exception to produce a 4xx.** A caller-error is
  detected by an explicit check and named; an unexpected exception is left
  to propagate, so it surfaces as a logged, detail-free 500 rather than
  being mis-reported to the caller as a validation failure. See
  `build_definition_document/1`'s own comment for the full statement of why
  (REQ-310 rework round 1, REVIEWER blocker 2).

  #
  # ## ⛔ This function is TOTAL: it never raises, and it never rejects
  #
  # It returns a document unconditionally. Judging whether that document is
  # a valid entity definition is `Letflow.Entities.Definition.Validator`'s
  # job alone, reached via `Definitions.create_definition/2` ->
  # `{:error, {:validation, violations}}` -> a 422 carrying the real
  # violation list with a per-field `path`.
  #
  # This replaces (REQ-310 rework round 1, REVIEWER blocker 2) an earlier
  # shape that wrapped the whole builder in a bare `rescue` producing one
  # detail-free `{:error, :invalid_definition_document}` -> 422 with NO
  # `errors` key. That was wrong three ways:
  #
  #   1. Its stated premise -- that the Validator would "silently read as
  #      empty" an unconverted value -- is FALSE. `field_shape_violations/1`
  #      tests `Map.get(field, :type) not in @field_types`, a MEMBERSHIP
  #      test that rejects the raw string `"strng"` exactly as it rejects a
  #      wrong atom; `check_required_list_of_maps/3` likewise already emits
  #      "fields entries must all be maps" for a non-map entry. Every
  #      malformation the rescue was catching already had a real, better
  #      violation waiting one layer down.
  #   2. `String.to_existing_atom/1` raising made the caller's error contract
  #      a function of UNRELATED GLOBAL VM STATE: `"type": "strng"` (no such
  #      atom) got the detail-free 422, while `"type": "ok"` (an atom some
  #      other module happens to have loaded) survived conversion and got a
  #      proper field error. Which error a typo produced depended on whether
  #      it collided with an atom loaded elsewhere in the BEAM.
  #   3. The `rescue` had no clause filter, so it would also have caught a
  #      genuine BUG anywhere in this builder and reported it to the caller
  #      as a 422 caller-validation failure, unlogged -- inverting INV-8,
  #      which requires an internal fault to surface as a detail-free 500 AND
  #      be logged. With no raise left to catch, that inversion is gone: an
  #      unexpected exception now propagates to the pipeline's own error
  #      handler as a logged 500, which is the correct INV-8 behaviour.
  #
  # So the conversions below are gated, not rescued: `closed_set_atom/2`
  # checks membership in a compile-time list FIRST and only then calls
  # `String.to_existing_atom/1`, exactly as `Letflow.Routers.Identity`'s
  # `handle_status_update/3` gates its own status conversion behind a
  # `FieldConstraint`'s `allowed_values` before converting. The atom can
  # therefore never be minted and the call can never raise. A value outside
  # the set is passed through UNCHANGED (still a string), where the
  # Validator's membership test rejects it by name and path.

  #
  # ⛔ `rationale` is `required: true`, and that is not a stylistic choice.
  # The delegate chain REJECTS a blank one: `Letflow.Repository.Activation.
  # activate_group/5` feeds it to `Letflow.Repository.ActivationGroup.
  # changeset/2`, whose `validate_required/2` rejects `nil`, `""` and any
  # whitespace-only string (cast/4 collapses all three to `nil`), with a
  # DB-level `CHECK (rationale <> '')` behind it. So an "optional" rationale
  # is not actually optional anywhere below this line -- declaring it
  # optional here and defaulting to `""` (REQ-310 rework round 1, REVIEWER
  # blocker 1) made an omission fail as `{:group, %Ecto.Changeset{}}`, which
  # this module's render clause collapses into an opaque, field-less 422
  # reading "entity definition could not be activated" and logs as an
  # activation failure rather than a validation one.
  #
  # The alternative -- keeping it optional and substituting a non-blank
  # server-side default -- was rejected: `rationale` is REPO-10's free-text
  # JUSTIFICATION requirement (`Letflow.Repository.Activation`'s moduledoc
  # names it the one mandatory field that table has and REQ-195's
  # `audit_entries` does not). Writing a synthesised justification nobody
  # authored into an append-only compliance trail defeats the field's only
