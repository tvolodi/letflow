defmodule Letflow.Routers.Help do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-366 §1 — the HTTP read route REQ-364's own scope explicitly deferred
  (`Letflow.Help`'s moduledoc: "No HTTP route/controller wiring... a route is
  a deliberately deferred fast-follow"). Implements
  `lib/letflow/design/req366-help-display-panel.md` §1 exactly (a
  CODE-DESIGN-VALIDATOR-approved design), not a fresh design of its own.

  Built by `ELIXIR-DEV` inside REQ-366 (nominally `FRONTEND-DEV`-owned) per
  the design's own §1.5/OQ-3 routing note: this is backend work
  (`lib/letflow/`, `lib/letflow/api/authorization.ex`) a frontend-owned
  requirement cannot itself build without violating WF-02 Step 2b's "close a
  contract mismatch on the Letflow side, never shim it in `web/`" rule.

  Mounted at `/help` by `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline`, the normal authenticated
  `/api/v1` forward chain every other tenant-scoped sub-router uses (design
  §1.1) — **not** an unauthenticated route: help content, even eventual
  platform-scope content (§1.4), is only ever shown to an already-
  authenticated user browsing a screen.

  ## Route

  | Handler | Method/path | Delegates to | Permission | Response |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | handle_resolve | `GET /help/resolved?screen_id=<string>[&process_definition_id=<uuid>]` | `Letflow.Help.get_by_screen/2` (REQ-364) + `Letflow.Definitions.get_by_id/2` (staleness comparison) | `:HelpRead` | 200 / 400 / 404 |

  ## Resolution algorithm (design §1.2, implemented verbatim)

  `Letflow.Help.get_by_screen/2` returns every row (draft and live) for a
  `screen_id`, unfiltered — resolving "the one row a panel should show" is
  this route's own job, not REQ-364's (its moduledoc states this explicitly).
  `select_live_row/2` below is design §1.2 steps 4a-4d's exact tie-break:

    a. only `:live` rows are ever candidates (a `:draft` row is never shown);
    b. if `process_definition_id` was supplied and a live row matches it,
       that row (or those rows) win over every generic (`process_definition_id
       == nil`) live row;
    c. otherwise, fall back to live rows with `process_definition_id == nil`;
    d. multiple surviving rows are broken by `updated_at` descending
       (deterministic — design's own OQ-1: this codebase has no "at most one
       live entry per screen" invariant, so *some* tie-break must exist).

  ## Staleness (design §1.2 step 6, §1.6)

  Computed server-side, never left to the frontend to re-derive (the whole
  point: the frontend never needs a second fetch of the process definition's
  version just to answer one boolean). `row.process_definition_id == nil` ->
  `stale` is always `false` (design §4.1's own stated limit — no comparison
  target exists for non-process help). Otherwise `Letflow.Definitions.get_by_id/2`
  resolves that process definition's *current* `:version`
  (`confirmed_for_definition_version` and `:version` are both `:string`
  fields — confirmed by direct schema read, not assumed) and `stale` is
  `row.confirmed_for_definition_version != that value`. If the referenced
  process definition can no longer be found (e.g. `Letflow.Definitions.hard_delete/2`
  ran after this help row was confirmed against it — not a state design §1.2
  anticipates), this route treats that as `stale: true` rather than silently
  reporting "not stale": the staleness signal cannot be confirmed fresh, so it
  defaults to the more conservative (visible-warning) reading, and a warning
  is logged since it indicates a genuinely anomalous cross-reference.

  ## Platform-scope fallback — extension point, not built (design §1.4)

  `platform_help_content` does not exist yet (REQ-365, `pending`, unclaimed).
  `handle_resolve/1`'s "no tenant-scoped row resolved" branch is therefore,
  in this run, a plain 404 — `resolved_help_json/3`'s `"scope"` field is
  always `"tenant"` today. §1.4's own text states the follow-up shape once
  REQ-365 lands: a small, additive change to this module's own
  `handle_resolve/1` body only, not a new route/response-shape/frontend
  change.

  ## `:HelpRead` permission (design §1.3) — CANDIDATE deliberately excluded

  Design §1.3 states `:HelpRead` "granted to all six roles... unconditionally
  on any recognized role" and flags this as **OQ-2**, explicitly inviting
  REVIEWER to judge a narrower grant instead. `lib/letflow/api/authorization.ex`
  implements a **deliberate, flagged deviation** from that literal instruction:
  `:HelpRead` is granted to `PLATFORM_ADMIN`, `PROCESS_DESIGNER`,
  `PROCESS_OPERATOR`, `TASK_WORKER`, and `AGENT_RUNNER`, but **not**
  `CANDIDATE`. Reason: `test/letflow/api/authorization_test.exs`'s
  `"role_allows?/2 grants CANDIDATE exactly its six ExamSession*/ExamCertificateIssue
  permissions, denying every other live permission"` test enforces a
  pre-existing, ISS-0646/decision-0013-addendum closed-set invariant for
  `CANDIDATE` ("must hold exactly its six ExamSession*/ExamCertificateIssue
  permissions and nothing else") — widening that set silently would be
  exactly the "don't silently re-decide what a decision record already
  settled" case this project's own core directives forbid. Flagged here,
  not resolved unilaterally: SECURITY-REVIEWER/REVIEWER (this run's own next
  two gates, per the design's §1.5) make the actual call between "keep
  CANDIDATE excluded" (this implementation) and "widen ISS-0646's own closed
  set for `:HelpRead` specifically" (design §1.3's literal instruction).

  ## Zero-detail 404 (INV-5)

  `Response.not_found/1` — the same zero-detail body/status every other
  router's "no such resource" branch already uses. There is no first-class
  distinction in this route's response between "screen_id has no help
  content at all" and any other not-found case; the frontend (§2.2.1 of the
  design) is the layer that treats a 404 here as "no help authored yet," not
  an error.
