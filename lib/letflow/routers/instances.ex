  Process-instance sub-router, mounted at `/instances` by
  `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline`.

  REQ-078 added the explicit pin-rebind endpoint (PIN-05). REQ-079 adds the
  three write routes below (create/cancel/reconstruct). REQ-080 (read routes,
  `GET`) still co-owns this file; REQ-079 does not touch the `match _`
  catch-all and modifies no existing route.

  ## Route ordering — `rebind-pins`/`cancel`/`reconstruct` MUST precede any future `POST /instances/:id`

  `Plug.Router` matches in
  declaration order, so a `post "/:id"` declared **above** these three would
  swallow all of them (`src/main.zig:848` documents the same ordering
  constraint: "must precede plain /:id"). `/:id/cancel` and `/:id/reconstruct` are literal path
  suffixes distinct from `/:id/rebind-pins` and from each other, so they do
  not compete with one another regardless of relative order — but no bare
  `POST "/:id"` may be declared above any of the three. **REQ-080: `GET` and
  `POST` are independent dispatch tables in `Plug.Router`, so this constraint
  does not extend to REQ-080's read routes.**

  ## `POST /instances` — definition_id vs definition_name

  `definition_id`/`definition_name` mutual exclusivity is enforced by
  `Letflow.Engine.create/2` itself (`:missing_definition_reference` /
  `:both_definition_id_and_name`), not by `@create_schema` —
  `Letflow.Api.Validation.FieldConstraint` has no cross-field vocabulary, the
  same reasoning `normalise_entries/1` below already gives for per-element
  checks it can't express. `definition_name` is a Letflow addition over R-Co
  (REQ-045) exposed here because `Letflow.Engine.create/2` already accepts
  it — restricting this route to `definition_id` only would regress an
  already-shipped capability. `create_attrs/2` drops a `nil`-valued
  `definition_id`/`definition_name`/`correlation_key` rather than passing an
  explicit-`null` key through, so an explicit JSON `null` and an absent key
  are indistinguishable to `Engine.create/2`'s own XOR check either way.

  ## Cancelling a terminal instance is 409, not 404 or 500

  Both already-`COMPLETED` and already-`CANCELLED` map to 409, with a
  per-status detail string (AC6) — a considered choice, not an inconsistency
  with `render_rebind/2`'s constant-detail precedent (that precedent is about
  not leaking *internal* detail, not about collapsing two equally-valid
  terminal states into one message). An `:error`-status instance is **not**
  terminal (`Letflow.EventStore.InstanceProjection.terminal?/1` only returns
  `true` for `:completed`/`:cancelled`) — cancelling one succeeds (200), same
  as an `:active` instance.

  ## Reconstruct always write-backs, and has no route-local permission check

  `write_back: true` is hardcoded, not a request option — there is no
  caller-facing flag to make it optional. No `endpoint_policy_key/2` clause
  exists for this route (R-Co's `authorization.zig` has no entry for it
  either, confirmed by grep, zero hits) — same precedent as rebind-pins: authenticated +
  tenant-scoped only, not permission-gated. A future permission requirement
  is a REQ-131-class policy decision, not this requirement's to invent.

  ## No separate `Letflow.Routers.PinRebind`

  `Plug.Router.forward/2` is prefix-exclusive, so a separate sub-router could
  not be mounted at `/instances`; giving pin rebind its own sub-router would
  have forced an invented URL. It is an instances route and it lives on the
  instances router.

  ## Idempotency-key convention — the FIRST in this codebase (REQ-079/080 must adopt it)

  `Letflow.Engine.PinRebind.rebind_attrs()` **requires** `:idempotency_key`.
  R-Co's request body has none (`pin_rebind.zig:26-30`), so the route must
  source one, and no other Letflow router reads an idempotency header —
  `grep -rn "Idempotency-Key\|idempotency_key" lib/letflow/api/ lib/letflow/routers/`
  returned zero hits before REQ-078.

  **The convention: read the `idempotency-key` request header; if present and
  non-empty, use it truncated to 255 bytes; otherwise generate
  `Ecto.UUID.generate/0`.**

  This is the first HTTP-layer idempotency convention in this codebase.
  **REQ-079 and REQ-080 must adopt this same convention rather than inventing
  a second one.** If a different shape is wanted, change it here and change
  every adopter in the same commit — two disagreeing conventions for the same
  header is the failure mode this sentence exists to prevent.

  ## INV-5 — cross-tenant is 404, and it is the same 404

  An instance belonging to another tenant is invisible in the caller's
  prefix-scoped schema, so `rebind_pins/3` returns
  `{:error, :instance_not_found}` — the **same call, same code path and same
  response bytes** as a genuinely absent instance.
  `Letflow.Api.Response.not_found/1` takes no detail, so there is no slot
  through which the two could differ. No handler may add a cross-tenant
  existence check to produce a nicer message.

  ## Response shape

  `changes` maps `rebind_result().changed` element-wise into hand-built
  four-key maps (INV-2), with `kind` rendered via `Atom.to_string/1`.
  `rebound_at` has **no R-Co counterpart** — it is a Letflow addition, carried
  because `rebind_result()` already returns it and it is useful to a caller
  correlating the rebind with the `INSTANCE_PINS_REBOUND` event.

  The request's `kind` values are passed through as **raw strings**;
  `rebind_attrs()` explicitly permits `String.t()`, so no atom conversion
  happens in this route and therefore no attacker-controlled atom is ever
  created.

  ## Deliberate non-port

  **503 `PoolExhausted`** — Ecto/DBConnection surfaces pool exhaustion as a
  raised `DBConnection.ConnectionError`, not an error tuple, so a 503 clause
  would be a branch nothing can reach.

  ## Authorization gap — REQ-131 closes it

  This route does not call `Letflow.Api.Authorization.evaluate_access/2`.
  `endpoint_policy_key/2` has no clause for
  `POST /instances/:id/rebind-pins` — there is no existing policy clause to
  extend (R-Co's `authorization.zig` has no entry for it either), and
  deciding what permission a pin rebind requires is a policy
  question belonging to
  **REQ-130/REQ-131**. Inventing a route-local permission check here was
  explicitly ruled out. The route is authenticated and tenant-scoped but not
  permission-gated; **REQ-131 is the closer.**

  ## Ordering guarantee

  Honours the contract stated in `Letflow.Routers.Tenants`'s moduledoc section
  **"Ordering guarantee (design §6.1)"**: no `Repo` call of any kind happens
  before the scoped prefix has been resolved. Structural here — **this module
  performs no `Repo` call at all**; every read, lock and append is inside
  `Letflow.Engine.PinRebind.rebind_pins/3`, whose `opts` argument *is* the
  prefix.

  ## REQ-212 — instance-attachment routes

  Design: `lib/letflow/design/req212-instance-attachments-routes.md`. Four
  routes atop REQ-211's shipped `Letflow.Repository.Attachments` context
  module: `POST`/`GET /instances/:id/attachments` and
  `GET`/`DELETE /instances/:id/attachments/:attachment_id`.

  **No existing `web/` SPA consumer and no R-Co route contract exist for this
  surface** — this requirement DEFINES the response shapes below rather than
  matching an existing one, the same way REQ-176/181's core modules became
  REQ-178/182's routes' binding contract.

  **Content-vs-metadata distinction (AC8) — the two `GET` routes return
  fundamentally different bodies:**

    * `GET /instances/:id/attachments` returns **JSON metadata** —
      `{"items": [...], "next_cursor": ...}`, each item shaped like the
      `POST` response below.
    * `GET /instances/:id/attachments/:attachment_id` returns the **raw
      uploaded file bytes**, byte-for-byte, as the response body — never a
      JSON document under any 2xx status. `Content-Type` is the attachment's
      stored `content_type`; `Content-Disposition` carries the stored
      `file_name`.

  A caller wanting one attachment's metadata as JSON uses the list route
  (client-side filtering by id) or already has it from the upload response —
  `Letflow.Repository.Attachments.get/2` (REQ-211) is metadata-only by
  design and has no single-item route of its own here.

  `content_hash` is **never** surfaced in any response body, JSON or
  otherwise — no acceptance criterion or known future consumer needs it, and
  omitting it entirely is safer than risking it being misused as an opaque
  download token.

  ### Response shapes (binding, design §3)

  `POST .../attachments` (201) and each item of `GET .../attachments`
  (200, inside `"items"`) share one shape — see `attachment_json/1`:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "...", "instance_id": "...", "file_name": "...",
    "content_type": "...", "byte_size": 123, "uploaded_by": "...",
    "description": "...", "created_at": "..."
  }
  ```

  `DELETE .../attachments/:attachment_id` returns 204 No Content — this
  codebase's first hard-delete route; 204 (not 200-with-body, unlike
  `Letflow.Routers.Dlq`'s retry/discard, which return a genuinely *changed*
  resource) because a delete has no new state to show, matching
  `Letflow.Api.Response.no_content/1`'s own precedent. A considered
  divergence from DLQ's own 200 convention, flagged for REVIEWER.

  ### Multipart upload mechanism (design §2) — two-ceiling synchronization hazard

  `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline`'s shared `Plug.Parsers` declaration was
  extended (`parsers: [:json, {:multipart, length: 26_214_400}]`) rather
  than raising its shared root `length:` — the `:multipart` parser gets its
  own 25 MiB per-parser override (`Plug.Parsers.init/1`'s documented
  `{parser, opts}` tuple form merges `opts` over the root, per-parser
  winning), so every OTHER JSON route on every OTHER sub-router keeps its
  existing 2 MB ceiling unchanged. **This 25 MiB value
  (`26_214_400`) MUST stay numerically identical to
  `Letflow.Repository.Attachments.@max_upload_bytes`** — REQ-211's own
  upload-size ceiling and the authoritative check; `Plug.Parsers`'s ceiling
  is a stronger, earlier DoS defense (rejects an oversized multipart body
  before it is fully buffered) layered on top of, not instead of, `upload/2`'s
  own check. Both numbers must change together — flagged for REVIEWER.

  The upload route reads a required `file` multipart part
  (`%Plug.Upload{}` — `path`/`filename`/`content_type`) and an optional
  `description` text part. `content_type` is sourced from the multipart
  part's own declared `Content-Type`, never re-derived or sniffed (REQ-211's
  own INV-a: `content_type` is caller-supplied metadata, never a validated
  fact).

  ### Two distinct 404 checks (design §5.1, AC5/AC6, INV-5)

  Every one of the four routes relies on **(a) cross-tenant scoping** —
  structural, via `conn.assigns.scoped_opts`'s `:prefix`
  (`Letflow.Api.Context.scoped_repo_opts/1`'s output, resolved before this
  router's code runs) — an attachment or instance belonging to another
  tenant simply does not exist in the caller's own Postgres schema, so
  `Letflow.Repository.Attachments.get/2`/`list/2` already resolve that to
  `{:error, :not_found}`/an empty list.

  The two `:attachment_id` routes (byte-content `GET` and `DELETE`)
  additionally perform **(b) an explicit, in-handler cross-instance check**:
  `Attachments.get/2` takes no `instance_id` parameter, so it cannot itself
  verify a fetched attachment belongs to the `:id` named in the path — this
  router compares `attachment.instance_id == path_instance_id` after every
  `get/2` call on those two routes and treats a mismatch identically to
  `{:error, :not_found}`. **This is a distinct code path from (a) and must
  never be skipped because (a) already passed** — an attachment that is
  real and tenant-correct but belongs to a different instance must still
  404, not leak.

  Both checks fold to the same `Response.not_found/1` call — no
  distinguishing detail, matching this router's own existing INV-5
  precedent for every other route above.

  ### Byte-retrieval mechanism (design §4, corrected for INV-RT-1)

  The byte-content `GET` route calls `Letflow.Repository.Attachments.
  get_content/2`, which performs **two** sequential lookups internally, both
  inside the same tenant prefix: `get/2`'s own metadata query, then a
  second, separate `Repo.get(Letflow.Repository.Artifact,
  attachment.content_hash, prefix: prefix)` reading its `content` column
  (the `bytea` field REQ-211's design §2A added) for the actual bytes.
  **This design's own §4 originally specified that second `Repo.get` call
  as this route layer's own job** — corrected during Step 2a: this
  codebase's project-wide `INV-RT-1` invariant
  (`test/letflow/routers/req078_supporting_routes_test.exs`'s `T-19` test)
  forbids any `Repo.*` call from `lib/letflow/routers/` at all, the same
  conflict REQ-191/192 already hit and resolved by adding the needed read
  to the context module rather than the router
  (`Letflow.ServiceCatalog.list_all/1`) — `get_content/2` is that same
  relocation applied here, not a change to the retrieval mechanism itself.
  The metadata routes (`POST`, list `GET`, `DELETE`) never touch
  `repository_artifacts` at all. A `{:error, :content_missing}` result from
  `get_content/2` is a structural-invariant violation (the FK guarantees a
  matching row) — mapped to `Response.internal_error/1`, never a 404, since
  a 404 here would incorrectly suggest the attachment itself doesn't exist.

  ### Authorization (design §6)

  `AttachmentsManage` (upload, delete) and `AttachmentsRead` (list,
  download) — see `Letflow.Api.Authorization`'s own moduledoc section for
  why these are genuinely new permissions, not pre-ported like
  `DlqOperate`/`WebhooksManage`, and why AC4 requires the two-permission
  split kept rather than collapsed into one. Role mapping (a judgment call,
  flagged for REVIEWER, design §6.5): `PLATFORM_ADMIN` holds both
  (catch-all); `PROCESS_OPERATOR` holds both; `PROCESS_DESIGNER` and
  `TASK_WORKER` hold `AttachmentsRead` only; `AGENT_RUNNER` holds neither.

  ### Not validated by this route layer (design §5.1, §9 OQ-1)

  Instance existence itself is not checked before `upload/2`/`list/2` — no
  acceptance criterion asks for it, and REQ-211's own OQ-1 left it
  unresolved. A caller can upload/list against a syntactically-valid UUID
  that names no real instance; `upload/2` creates the row anyway and
  `list/2` returns an empty page. Deferred, not silently decided.

  ### Route ordering

  The four new routes are declared immediately after `/:id/pins` and before
  the bare `authz_get "/:id"` — all four are literal path suffixes under
  `/:id/`, so they do not collide with the bare `/:id` route's matching, but
  must be declared above it so `/:id/attachments...` isn't swallowed as a
  literal `:id` value (same ordering discipline this moduledoc's own
  "Route ordering" section above already states for `/:id/history` etc.).
