defmodule Letflow.Routers.Modules do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-404 — the D4/D5 module-router dispatch mount. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req404-module-router-mount.md` for the full design (a
  CODE-DESIGN-VALIDATOR-approved design), not a fresh design of its own.

  Mounted at `/modules` by `Letflow.Plugs.ApiPipeline` (full path
  `/api/v1/modules/<module_id>/<rest...>`).

  ## A plain `Plug`, not `Letflow.Api.AuthorizedRouter` (design §1.1)

  `AuthorizedRouter`'s `plug(:match) -> plug(Letflow.Plugs.Authorize) ->
  plug(:dispatch)` chain runs a permission check on EVERY request before any
  handler code runs. D5 requires the OPPOSITE order here: "is this module
  installed for this tenant" must be answered, and can return 404, BEFORE
  any permission evaluation, for every role including `PLATFORM_ADMIN`. So
  this dispatcher does no authorization evaluation of its own — it forwards
  to the module's own `router/0` (an `AuthorizedRouter`-based router, per
  the module contract's `router/0` callback), which performs the REAL
  permission check.

  ## D5's ordering invariant, restated precisely for this dispatcher

  No branch in `call/2` below ever calls
  `Letflow.Api.Authorization.evaluate_access/2` or any function that does.
  The only downstream code that evaluates a permission is the
  forwarded-to module's own `Letflow.Plugs.Authorize`, reached only after
  every 404 branch below has already been cleared.

  ## Response-body minimality / no information leak (D5)

  Every 404 branch below calls the exact same zero-argument
  `Letflow.Api.Response.not_found/1` — the response cannot distinguish
  "module doesn't exist" from "module exists but isn't installed for you"
  from "module exists, installed, but has no `router/0`."

  ## INV-1 (tenant scoping is server-derived only)

  `scoped_opts` here is derived exclusively from
  `conn.assigns.auth_context.tenant_id` via
  `Letflow.Api.Context.scoped_repo_opts/1` — the identical function and
  identical source `Letflow.Plugs.Authorize` itself uses. No path segment,
  query parameter, or header is read for tenant identification.

  ## D3 (module boundary)

  This file never names a concrete module. Every module reference here is
  one of `Letflow.Modules.Catalog`, `Letflow.Modules.Installs`, or a
  runtime value (`entry_module`) obtained from `Catalog.fetch/1` — never a
  literal `Letflow.Modules.<id>` name.

  ## INV-5 timing parity (design §9, post-SECURITY-REVIEWER amendment)

  `resolve/2` below computes `Installs.installed?/2`'s DB round trip
  UNCONDITIONALLY, independent of the free in-memory catalog/router-export
  checks — never behind a short-circuiting `with`-chain gated on those
  checks. Every request that reaches `resolve/2` pays exactly one DB round
  trip, whether `module_id` is unknown to the catalog, known but has no
  `router/0`, or known-and-installed. This closes a real timing side
  channel: a `with`-chain that fails the free catalog check first (0 DB
  round trips) versus one that clears it and only then fails the DB-backed
  install check (1 DB round trip) lets a caller distinguish "module never
  registered" from "registered but not installed for you" purely by
  latency — forbidden by INV-5/D5. See design §9.1–§9.4 for the full
  analysis, including why reordering the chain (instead of decoupling the
  DB check from short-circuit evaluation entirely) does not fix it.
