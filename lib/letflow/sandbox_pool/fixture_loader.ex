defmodule Letflow.SandboxPool.FixtureLoader do
  @moduledoc """
  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  Loads a fixed list of fixture rows into a claimed sandbox schema's allowlisted tables,
  TRUNCATE-ing each distinct target table first (ports R-Co's
  `src/definition/fixture_loader.zig` per PRM-06 §3 — see
  `src/design/prm-batch1-promotion-assertion-rerun.md`).

  The allowlist is the SQL-injection boundary: a fixture's `table_name` is checked
  against a hardcoded list (`process_definitions`, `instance_definition_snapshots`)
  before any SQL is issued for it — see `lib/letflow/design/
  req039-sandbox-pool-fixture-loader.md` §5.2 for why this list diverges from R-Co's own
  (two of R-Co's three allowlisted tables have no Letflow equivalent yet), and §11 OQ-1
  for how a future requirement extends it. `sandbox_schema` is independently validated
  against the exact shape `Letflow.SandboxPool.claim/1` always produces before any
  interpolation, closing the same injection class on the schema-name dimension (design
  doc §5.5 INV-FL-1) — nothing in this module's own call graph guarantees a caller
  passes an already-valid schema name before this point, so it is validated
  explicitly here rather than assumed safe.
