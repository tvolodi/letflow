defmodule Letflow.Scheduler.Poller do
  @moduledoc """
  Supervised `GenServer` ticker implementing REQ-185 §2's Decision 1
  (supervised `GenServer` ticker) and §6's Decision 5 (iterates tenant
  schemas per tick). See `lib/letflow/design/req186-scheduler-core.md` §3
  for the full design this module implements.

  `init/1` schedules its **first** `:tick` message with **zero** delay, so
  a restart catches up on missed timers with no special-cased recovery
  logic.

  ## State (REQ-188 addition — no longer "no meaningful state")

  Prior to REQ-188 this GenServer carried no meaningful state between
  ticks — a pure scheduling loop. REQ-188 widens `state` from `%{}` to
  `%{last_retention_run_at: DateTime.t() | nil}`, the ONE field this
  process now carries, solely to track retention-sweep cadence (see
  `Letflow.Scheduler.retention_due?/1`). It is initialized to `nil` in
  `init/1` and updated only when a retention sweep actually runs. No other
  state is introduced; the timer-poll loop itself remains stateless.

  Config (`config :letflow, :scheduler, [...]`, `Letflow.Scheduler`'s own
  accessors) is read fresh on every tick, so a runtime override (e.g. a
  test calling `Application.put_env/3`) takes effect on the very next tick.

  Jitter is applied only to the inter-tick scheduling delay, never to any
  `fire_at` value (SCH-06) -- when `jitter_ms()` is `0`, no random draw is
  made at all, the delay is exactly `poll_interval_ms()`.

  A raise inside one tenant schema's `Letflow.Scheduler.poll_and_fire/1` call
  is additionally guarded by a top-level `try/rescue` at this sweep's
  `Task.async_stream/3` call site (ISS-0421 design §4b), even though that
  function's own contract (design §2.2) already guarantees it never raises.
  This is no longer redundant now that iteration is concurrent:
  `Task.async_stream/3`'s failure blast radius (the whole in-flight batch,
  were an unhandled raise to reach it) is categorically larger than
  `Enum.each/2`'s ever was (only the rest of that one serial loop), so
  relying solely on the callee's own non-raising contract became a
  materially bigger bet than it was before that fix -- see the "ISS-0421
  addition" section below.

  ## REQ-219 addition -- test-only forced-crash seam (`force_poller_crash`)

  `handle_info(:tick, state)`'s first expression is a double-gated guard
  that unconditionally raises when both gates are open, used by
  `test/letflow/supervisor/pollers_test.exs`'s AC4 crash-loop-isolation
  test (`req219-supervision-layering.md` §5) to reproduce, on demand, the
  exact "Poller raises on every tick" scenario that motivated
  `Letflow.Supervisor.Pollers`' own `max_restarts: 5, max_seconds: 60`
  override. Mirrors `lib/letflow/repository/activation.ex`'s own
  `@activation_test_hooks_enabled?` double-gate pattern exactly, and
  DELIBERATELY REUSES that same existing, already-committed compile-time
  config key rather than introducing a new one (a new key would need its
  own `config/test.exs` entry, violating REQ-219 AC7's "no config file
  changes" bar). Structurally unreachable in a compiled dev/prod release:
  `@poller_test_hooks_enabled?` is resolved once at compile time and folds
  to a literal `false` in every build except one compiled with
  `:activation_test_hooks_enabled?: true` (only `config/test.exs` sets
  this), so no runtime `Application.put_env(:letflow, :force_poller_crash,
  true)` call -- by a future ops script, console session, or otherwise --
  can ever reach this branch outside a test build. The runtime
  `Application.get_env/3` check (read fresh per call, matching this
  module's own existing "config read fresh on every tick" convention) is
  what lets one specific test flip the behavior on/off without a fresh
  compile.

  ## ISS-0421 addition -- bounded per-tenant concurrency within each sweep
  (design `iss0421-poller-bounded-concurrency.md`)

  Each of the seven per-tenant sweeps below iterates `schemas` via
  `Task.async_stream/3` instead of `Enum.each/2`, bounding how many tenants'
  calls are in flight together for that ONE sweep. The seven sweeps
  themselves remain strictly sequential relative to each other (design §2) --
  only the per-tenant iteration *inside* a single sweep is now concurrent.

  Two concurrency-bound classes (design §3):

    * The six Admission-gated sweeps (poll-and-fire, retention, alert
      detection, ordering cycle/sweeper/metrics) use `max_concurrency: 8`,
      i.e. exactly `Admission.global_cap` at default config (`pool_size(10) -
      reserved_headroom(2)`). This is a literal, not derived live, because
      `Admission.try_acquire(:global)`'s own non-blocking gate is already the
      true ceiling on concurrent `DBConnection` checkouts for these six
      sweeps regardless of this value (design §3a) -- raising it above 8
      cannot push checkouts past 8, it would only spawn extra BEAM processes
      that immediately lose the admission race.
    * `maybe_refresh_active_instances/1` (the one sweep with NO Admission
      backstop) instead uses `Letflow.Admission.reserved_headroom/0`'s LIVE
      return value, read fresh inside that sweep's own function body every
      tick, never cached or hoisted -- this is the one sweep where the
      `Task.async_stream` bound IS the only thing standing between the fix
      and pool exhaustion, so it must always track Admission's own
      configured headroom rather than duplicate it as an independent literal
      (design §3b's `global_cap + max_concurrency = pool_size` identity).

  Every `Task.async_stream/3` call site sets `timeout:
  Scheduler.sweep_task_timeout_ms()`, `on_timeout: :kill_task` (a timed-out
  task is killed and yielded as an `{:exit, {schema_name, :timeout}}`
  element, rather than crashing this GenServer the way the library's own
  `on_timeout: :exit` default would), and `zip_input_on_exit: true` (so a
  timeout/crash exit tuple carries which schema it belongs to, for logging).
  The poll-and-fire loop and the retention sweep -- the two call sites with
  no pre-existing inline rescue -- additionally wrap their per-schema
  function in a top-level `try/rescue` (design §4b): `Task.async_stream/3`'s
  own failure blast radius (the whole concurrent batch) is categorically
  larger than `Enum.each/2`'s ever was, so a callee's own non-raising
  contract is no longer a safe-enough bet on its own. The other four sweeps
  already wrap their op call in an inline `try/rescue -> :ok` and need no
  second, redundant one.

  ## REQ-218 addition -- admission-control wiring on the six sequential
  per-tenant operations (design `req218-poller-admission-wiring.md`)

  Each of the six named operations below (the timer poll-and-fire loop
  plus the five `maybe_run_*` sweeps) acquires ONE `:global` admission
  unit via `Letflow.Admission.try_acquire/1` for that operation's own
  single per-schema call, and releases it via an `after` clause on the
  wrapping `try` -- guaranteeing release even if some future edit to the
  wrapped operation let an exception past its own existing rescue. On
  `{:error, :capacity}`, that one schema's turn for that one operation is
  skipped for this tick only (logged at `Logger.warning/1`, matching
  `lib/letflow/tenant_provisioning/backfill.ex:37,44` and
  `lib/letflow/obs/alerts.ex:588`'s skip-and-continue precedent) -- every
  other schema, and every other operation, proceeds independently. Only
  `:global` is ever acquired here, never the per-tenant pool -- Poller already
  iterates every tenant schema once per tick by design (REQ-186), so a
  per-tenant cap would only cause silent, unfair skips rather than bound
  anything meaningful for a background sweep. `maybe_refresh_active_instances/1`
  (REQ-194) is deliberately left UNWRAPPED -- not one of REQ-218's six
  named operations.

  ## REQ-194 addition -- `letflow_active_instances` refresh (design
  `req194-prometheus-metrics.md` §6)

  Each tick, after the timer poll-and-fire loop, sums
  `Letflow.Engine.count_instances_by_status/1`'s `:active` key across the SAME
  `tenant_schemas()` list already computed for that tick (no second query) and
  writes the platform-wide total to `Letflow.Metrics.Registry.set_active_instances/1`
  -- this is the one OBS-02 metric family that is NOT `:telemetry`-driven (see that
  module's moduledoc for why).

  Two failure isolation layers, both required so a database outage degrades this one
  metric rather than crashing the whole scheduler (a crashed Poller stops every
  tenant's timers firing platform-wide, a vastly worse regression than a stale
  gauge):

    * `tenant_schemas/0` itself raising (the DB is unreachable entirely) is caught by
      `fetch_tenant_schemas/0` below -- on failure, this tick's poll-and-fire loop
      AND the active-instances refresh are BOTH skipped (there is nothing to iterate
      either one over), `mark_active_instances_refresh_failed/0` is called, and the
      next tick is still scheduled normally. This is a deliberate, flagged deviation
      from the design's literal "the timer poll-and-fire loop for that tick still
      proceeds normally" wording: that loop's own input (`schemas`) is exactly what
      failed to compute, so "proceeding normally" over an empty/undefined list is not
      meaningfully different from skipping it outright -- flagged for REVIEWER.
    * One individual schema's `count_instances_by_status/1` call raising (a single
      tenant's schema corrupted or mid-migration) is caught per-schema in
      `count_active_for_schema/1` -- that schema contributes `0` to the sum and every
      other schema, plus the timer poll-and-fire loop, is unaffected.
