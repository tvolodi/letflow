defmodule Letflow.Scheduler.RecordDeadlineSweep do
  @moduledoc """
  Generic deadline-driven record transition sweep (REQ-331). Given a
  **configured** entity type, datetime field, and status field/value, finds
  records in one tenant schema whose datetime field is in the past and whose
  status field matches, and applies a configured status transition to each,
  one `Repo.transaction/1` per record. Called by
  `Letflow.Scheduler.Poller`'s eighth per-tenant sweep -- this module itself
  starts no process and owns no state, the same "plain context module called
  by Poller" shape `Letflow.Scheduler`/`Letflow.Ordering` already use.

  Provenance: FR-BB310, `backend/internal/sessions/autojob.go`. Cited here
  as a bare path plus FR-BB id only, per 0022 rule 1 and this requirement's
  own hard constraint -- no further description of what that file does is
  given in this module, its comments, or its tests.

  ## Rule-1 vocabulary constraint (hard, checked mechanically)

  No module, function, config key, permission atom, log message, error
  atom, test name, or comment produced for this requirement names the six
  forbidden words. A `rule()` is fully generic: an entity type name, a
  datetime field name, a status field name/value pair, a new status value,
  and two optional extras (a completion-timestamp field, a post-commit
  callback) -- nothing here is specific to any one vertical.

  ## Where a sweep rule is declared, who may declare one, permission atom

  A `rule()` is declared in **Application config** (`config :letflow,
  :deadline_sweep, rules: [...]`), read fresh on every call via
  `Application.get_env/3` -- never cached, matching this platform's existing
  `:ordering`/`:alert_hooks` config-gated sweeps
  (`lib/letflow/scheduler/poller.ex`'s own `maybe_run_ordering_cycle/1` and
  `maybe_run_alert_detection/3`), which are declared exactly the same way for
  exactly the same reason. This is a **deploy-time, platform-operator-only**
  declaration -- there is no HTTP route, permission-gated action, or any
  other runtime mechanism by which a tenant (or anyone acting as one) can
  create, edit, or remove a rule. Consequently **no new permission atom is
  needed**: nothing in this requirement's scope exposes a capability that a
  permission could gate, because nothing here is reachable from tenant-scoped
  request handling at all.

  This directly satisfies the INV-1 constraint this requirement's own
  acceptance criteria name ("a tenant cannot configure a sweep over another
  tenant's data") **by construction, not by an application-level check**: since
  no tenant-facing code path can write or influence `:deadline_sweep` config,
  there is no way for a tenant to configure anything here in the first place,
  for its own data or anyone else's. What INV-1 *does* still require -- and
  what `run/2` still enforces explicitly -- is that every read and write this
  module issues carries the tenant schema it was asked to sweep as an
  explicit `prefix:` option (never a `tenant_id` looked up from the config or
  from a query result), so the *same* rule, applied identically to every
  schema `Letflow.Scheduler.Poller` iterates, only ever reads and writes
  inside the one schema it was called for.

  A config-key/deploy-only declaration was chosen over an
  `entity_definitions`-attribute or a new dedicated table for the same reason
  `docs/requirements.yaml`'s REQ-331 text itself gives for bucket B over
  bucket A: a definition is declarative data with no execution context, and
  this platform's declared verticals do not yet need a **tenant-self-service**
  way to declare a sweep rule (no acceptance criterion asks for one) -- adding
  either a definition attribute or a new table now, ahead of a real caller
  needing tenant-level self-service, would be exactly the speculative-generality
  failure mode `docs/anti-patterns.md`/decision `0022` both exist to prevent.
  If a future requirement needs a tenant to self-declare its own rule, that is
  a new requirement's own scope, not a silent widening of this one.

  ## Concurrency (AC-9)

  Two application instances (or two concurrent sweep ticks) must never
  transition the same row twice. `run/2` claims and transitions **one**
  record at a time -- `fetch_one_due_locked/3`'s query ends in `limit(1) |>
  lock("FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED")`, executed inside the *same*
  `Repo.transaction/1` call that performs the transition, so the lock is held
  for exactly the duration of that one record's own write. A second, truly
  concurrent caller racing for the same row gets `nil` back from that locked
  `Repo.one/2` (SKIP LOCKED excludes an already-locked row rather than
  blocking for it) and moves on to whatever else is due -- see
  `test/letflow/scheduler/record_deadline_sweep_test.exs`'s
  "AC-4 SKIP LOCKED" describe block for the empirical proof, including how it
  was validated that removing the lock clause makes the test fail.

  ## Per-record transaction isolation (AC-8)

  `sweep_tenant/2` claims and transitions records one at a time in a loop,
  each iteration its own `Repo.transaction/1` call (via `claim_and_transition_one/2`).
  A record whose transition fails (a changeset error, a raised exception
  from `Letflow.Entities.Records.update_record/2`, anything) rolls back
  *only that one record's* transaction via `Repo.rollback/1` and is logged;
  the loop continues to the next due record regardless, and every other
  tenant schema `Letflow.Scheduler.Poller` iterates is wholly unaffected
  (that isolation lives in `Poller`'s own `run_sweep/4` `try/rescue`, not
  here).

  ## The completion-timestamp detail (AC-3/AC-5)

  When a `rule()` names a `:completion_field`, the transitioned record's
  `field_values[completion_field]` is set to the **exact, unmodified string
  value already stored** at `field_values[datetime_field]` -- the deadline
  the record was due against -- never to `DateTime.utc_now()` at the moment
  the sweep actually ran. A record due at `T` and swept at `T` plus any delay
  still completes at `T`. See
  `test/letflow/scheduler/record_deadline_sweep_test.exs`'s "AC-6 completion
  timestamp" describe block, which asserts the exact value, not a range.
