defmodule Letflow.Supervisor.Pollers do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-219 (design `req219-supervision-layering.md` §1.2/§3): owns the two
  independently-gated poller `GenServer`s -- `Letflow.Scheduler.Poller`
  (REQ-186, gated `:start_scheduler`) and
  `Letflow.Engine.ServiceTaskDispatcher.Poller` (REQ-214, gated
  `:start_service_task_dispatcher`) -- each still individually gated by its
  own existing config key (REQ-214's own "independent poll cadences,
  independent boot gates" framing; letting a future host disable one
  without the other). With both gates `false` (`config/test.exs`'s current
  setting), `init/1` returns an empty children list -- fully supported by
  the `Supervisor` behaviour: this supervisor starts, holds zero children,
  and stays alive doing nothing until the application stops.

  ## Restart intensity override -- DELIBERATE, not the OTP default

  `max_restarts: 5, max_seconds: 60` -- looser than the OTP default (3
  restarts/5 seconds) to tolerate a handful of transient per-tick failures
  (a single bad HTTP dispatch, a single locked row) without this
  supervisor itself exiting, while still bounding a genuine, sustained
  crash-loop to a bounded number of restart attempts before THIS
  supervisor (only) exits and is restarted once by the top-level
  `Letflow.Supervisor`.

  This closes the documented, non-hypothetical incident this requirement
  exists for: a Poller whose zero-delay first tick
  (`Process.send_after(self(), :tick, 0)`) raises
  `DBConnection.OwnershipError` repeatedly under Ecto sandbox mode (or any
  other sustained per-tick fault) used to exhaust the SHARED top-level
  supervisor's restart intensity and take the WHOLE application --
  `Letflow.Repo` and Bandit included -- down with it (`scheduler_children/0`'s
  own historical comment, superseded by this structure, and ISS-0421).
  Now, `Letflow.Supervisor.Infrastructure` and `Letflow.Supervisor.Http`
  are never touched: `:one_for_one` at the top level means this
  supervisor's own exit only restarts itself.

  DELIBERATE, ACCEPTED CONSEQUENCE: within this supervisor, the two
  pollers are peers under `:one_for_one`. Once ONE poller's own crash-loop
  exhausts this shared 5-restarts/60-seconds budget, THIS SUPERVISOR
  itself exits and restarts, which restarts BOTH pollers together (if both
  are configured to run) -- restarting the supervisor process necessarily
  restarts everything under it. This is an accepted consequence of
  `:one_for_one`-at-two-levels, not a gap: REQ-219's own AC4 only requires
  `Letflow.Repo`/`Letflow.Supervisor.Infrastructure`/`Letflow.Supervisor.Http`
  to survive a poller crash-loop, never that the OTHER poller survives its
  sibling's crash-loop.

  ## Test-only ordering probe (`pollers_init_probe`)

  Double-gated exactly like `lib/letflow/repository/activation.ex`'s
  `@activation_test_hooks_enabled?` seam -- DELIBERATELY REUSING that same
  existing, already-committed compile-time config key
  (`:activation_test_hooks_enabled?`) rather than introducing a new one,
  because a new key would need its own `config/test.exs` entry, which
  would violate REQ-219 AC7's "no config file changes" bar; the existing
  key is already `true` under test (`config/test.exs:209`, predating this
  requirement). REVIEWER should confirm this reuse is an acceptable,
  explicitly-flagged trade rather than scope creep or accidental coupling
  between the activation and supervisor test seams -- the two features
  share nothing but this one boolean compile-time gate.

  If `@supervisor_test_hooks_enabled?` (resolved once at compile time,
  `false` in every dev/prod build since only `config/test.exs` sets the
  underlying key to `true`) is `true` AND
  `Application.get_env(:letflow, :pollers_init_probe)` is a 1-arity
  function, `init/1` calls it, as its very first expression, with
  `Process.whereis(Letflow.Obs.Alerts.TaskSupervisor)`'s result, before
  computing the two gated poller children -- used by
  `test/letflow/supervisor/pollers_test.exs`'s cold-boot ordering test
  (REQ-219 AC2) to observe, at the exact moment this module's `init/1`
  runs, whether `Letflow.Supervisor.Infrastructure` has already fully
  started. In any compiled dev/prod build, `@supervisor_test_hooks_enabled?`
  folds to a literal `false` and the whole branch is dead code -- this
  probe can never run in production regardless of any runtime
  `Application.put_env/3` call.
