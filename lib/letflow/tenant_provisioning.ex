defmodule Letflow.TenantProvisioning do
  @moduledoc """
  PROVENANCE (historical, not current decision authority):
  Context module for schema-per-tenant provisioning — the mechanism
  `docs/migration/decisions/0003-ecto-schema-strategy.md` Decision B named but
  explicitly deferred out of REQ-015's scope (see
  `lib/letflow/design/identity-schema.md` section 1's "Follow-up work this
  creates"). Resolves that deferral: a `tenant_schemas` registry
  (`Letflow.TenantProvisioning.Registration`), a schema-provisioning function
  (`provision_tenant_schema/1`, mirroring R-Co's
  `public.bpm_provision_tenant_schema(p_tenant_id UUID)`), and a
  migration-replay mechanism (`replay_migrations/2`, mirroring R-Co's
  `src/db/migrations.zig`'s `runForSchema`).

  Matches this project's established `Letflow.Identity`-style pattern: a
  top-level context module in `lib/letflow/`, backed by schema file(s) in a
  same-named subdirectory (`lib/letflow/tenant_provisioning/registration.ex`).

  `provision_tenant_schema/1` and `replay_migrations/2` are two separate,
  composable primitives — neither calls the other. A future tenant-onboarding
  orchestration requirement sequences them explicitly; that orchestration is
  not built here (see `lib/letflow/design/req022-tenant-schema-provisioning.md`
  §3.2's "No implicit chaining invariant").

  See `lib/letflow/design/req022-tenant-schema-provisioning.md` for the full
  design this module implements.

  ## Open question (REQ-022 acceptance criterion 4 — not resolved here)

  REQ-015's `users`/`groups`/`tenant_role` tables currently live in the public
  default schema (per `lib/letflow/design/identity-schema.md` section 1's
  deferral). This requirement does not retrofit those three tables to live
  under each tenant's own schema — only `tenants` and this module's own
  `tenant_schemas` registry are structurally global (a realm→tenant lookup
  must run before any tenant schema is known, so those two cannot live inside
  a tenant schema by construction). Whether `users`/`groups`/`tenant_role`
  *should* eventually be retrofitted behind `:prefix` (precedent: R-Co's
  identity tables underwent the identical move behind schema-per-tenant,
  at migration-060) is left open for a future requirement to decide
  explicitly — not assumed either way by this module.

  ## `replay_migrations/2` also seeds platform event types (REQ-045 §9 OQ-3a,
  ## extended by ISS-0072/GH#257)

  When `replay_migrations/2` is called with its default `migration_source`
  (i.e. the real `tenant_scoped_migrations/0` manifest, not a caller-supplied
  one), it seeds 6 `event_type_registry` rows — `"INSTANCE_STARTED"`,
  `"TASK_COMPLETED"`, `"INSTANCE_CANCELLED"`, `"INSTANCE_PINS_REBOUND"`,
  `"SUB_PROCESS_COMPLETED"`, and `"EXECUTION_ERROR"` — immediately after
  migrations apply successfully. `Letflow.EventStore.Registry.validate_payload/3`
  otherwise fails closed with `{:error, :unknown_event_type}` for every
  tenant, since no shipped migration seeds these rows -- a 20-built-in-type
  seed was deliberately left out of
  `20260816163103_create_event_type_registry.exs` (that migration's own
  header comment: "nothing yet exists that emits them"). `INSTANCE_STARTED`
  was seeded first, for `Letflow.Engine.create/2` (REQ-045). The other 5 were
  added by ISS-0072/GH#257, which found each already had a real production
  writer (`Letflow.Engine.complete_task/3`, `Letflow.Engine.cancel_instance/3`,
  `Letflow.Engine.PinRebind.rebind_pins/3`, `Letflow.Engine.SubProcess`'s
  sub-process completion path, and
  `Letflow.Engine.ExecutionError.append_execution_error_event/2`
  respectively) with no corresponding registry row — a pre-existing
  operational gap, closed here. Idempotent, and skipped entirely when a
  caller passes an explicit `migration_source` (so
  `test/support/req022_migration_fixture.ex`'s fixture-only replay is
  unaffected). See `replay_migrations/2`'s own private
  `maybe_seed_platform_event_types/2` for the full reasoning.

  ## Secondary open question (surfaced during design, not in REQ-022's
  original list)

  Should `provision_tenant_schema/1` or some other entry point eventually
  validate that a tenant's `Letflow.Identity.Tenant.status` is `:active` (not
  `:migrating`) before provisioning proceeds? REQ-021's
  `Letflow.Plugs.TenantStatus` already gates *mutating requests* on this
  status for existing tenants; `provision_tenant_schema/1` does not check it —
  left for a future tenant-onboarding-orchestration requirement to decide
  explicitly.

  ## No reconciliation path for a half-provisioned tenant (ISS-0230/GH#468 —
  ## OBLIGATION ON WHOEVER BUILDS THE ONBOARDING ORCHESTRATION)

  **Read this before sequencing the two primitives above from any new call
  site.** A caller that runs `Letflow.Identity.create_tenant/1` →
  `provision_tenant_schema/1` → `replay_migrations/2` commits the `tenants` row
  first. If either later step fails, the row stays committed and the tenant is
  left half-provisioned. There is **no** reconciliation, retry, or sweep
  mechanism anywhere in this codebase that will ever notice or repair such a
  tenant — nothing calls these two functions except the caller that just failed.

  A compensating rollback is **deliberately not** the answer and must not be
  added (REVIEWER's finding on ISS-0230): if `provision_tenant_schema/1` already
  succeeded and only `replay_migrations/2` failed, deleting the `tenants` row
  orphans a real Postgres schema plus a `tenant_schemas` row pointing at a
  `tenant_id` no longer present in `tenants` — trading a recoverable partial
  state for an unrecoverable orphan.

  Measured first-hand in run `WF03-ISS0230-20260822` (real Postgres, replay
  forced to fail), so the next implementer does not have to re-derive it:

    * `replay_migrations/2` returns a clean `{:error, {:migration_failed, _}}`;
      it does not raise, so a `with/else` at the call site sees it.
    * The resulting state is: `tenants` row present, `tenant_schemas` row
      present, the Postgres schema created but **empty**, and
      `Registration.migrations_applied_at` `nil`.
    * `migrations_applied_at IS NULL` is therefore already a sufficient,
      shipped **detection** predicate for "provisioned but not migrated" — a
      sweep needs no new column.
    * Re-invoking **both** primitives with the same `tenant_id` fully converges
      the state (`migrations_applied_at` set, tables present, still exactly one
      `tenant_schemas` row). The recovery *capability* exists today; only the
      orchestration that invokes it does not.
    * The tenant's `status` was `:active` throughout — an unmigrated tenant is
      currently advertised as fully live. Whoever builds onboarding should
      decide this together with the secondary open question above: creating the
      tenant `:migrating` and flipping to `:active` only after replay succeeds
      would make the partial state self-describing and would let
      `Letflow.Plugs.TenantStatus` reject *writes* against it with 503.
      **But `:migrating` is not a complete answer, and it is not free.** That
      plug gates write methods only (`@write_methods ~w(POST PUT PATCH
      DELETE)`; its other `call/2` clause returns the conn untouched), so
      `GET`/`HEAD` pass through with no status check and no DB query at all —
      a `:migrating` half-provisioned tenant would still serve *reads* straight
      onto the empty schema, hitting a relation that does not exist. Closing or
      explicitly accepting that read gap is part of the decision, not something
      `:migrating` hands you for free.

  What REQ-076 owes is an **invocable** recovery entry point — a function an
  operator or a test calls with a `tenant_id`. An automatic reconciliation
  sweep is deliberately *not* in scope: it needs a scheduler, there is no
  scheduler subsystem to hang one on, and adding a supervision-tree child for
  it is scope creep. The `migrations_applied_at IS NULL` predicate is recorded
  above so a future sweep requirement need not re-derive it — not as licence to
  build the sweep now.

  This is left unbuilt here on purpose. Adding a function to this module that
  calls both primitives would be exactly the coupling
  `lib/letflow/design/req022-tenant-schema-provisioning.md` §3.2's "No implicit
  chaining invariant" forbids; the orchestration layer is a caller's job, not
  this module's. `REQ-076` (tenant onboarding, S4) owns that layer and carries
  an explicit acceptance criterion for this gap — see its entry in
  `docs/requirements.yaml`. `docs/issues/ISS-0230.yaml` records the full
  reasoning.

  ## REQ-297 — entity column-promotion executor (AC6 moduledoc citation)

  See `docs/migration/decisions/0024-entity-promotion-ddl-execution.md` (the
  decision) and `lib/letflow/design/req297-entity-promotion-executor.md`
  (the design this section of the module implements) for the full detail.
  This module implements all four of 0024's sub-answers:

  1. **The mechanism**: this module (`Letflow.TenantProvisioning`), extended
     — not a second module — issues `ALTER TABLE`/`CREATE TABLE` directly
     against a tenant's own Postgres schema.
  2. **Partial-failure**: per-tenant, tracked one row per
     `(tenant_id, entity_type, attribute)` in `entity_column_promotions`
     (`Letflow.TenantProvisioning.ColumnPromotion`) — no cross-tenant
     atomicity; each tenant's row succeeds or fails on its own, and repair
     (`retry_failed_column_promotion/1`) retries only that one row.
  3. **Backfill**: a replay through
     `Letflow.Entities.Record.Projector.rebuild_projection/2` (never an
     inline `UPDATE`), with dual-write into the per-entity-type table kept
     current for the whole `ddl_applied..backfilled` window.
  4. **Rollback**: `suspend_column_promotion/2` flips `query_eligible` to
     `false` (query-layer exclusion via the future `Allowlist`), leaving
     `status` at `"active"` — never a drop or narrow of the column itself.

  ## REQ-298 — constraint_def unique-index activation and fk_def referential
  ## integrity (AC6 moduledoc citation)

  See `docs/migration/decisions/0025-promoted-fk-ondelete-and-localized-text-search-strategy.md`
  and `lib/letflow/design/req298-constraint-fk-activation.md` for the
  decision and design this section implements. Extends REQ-296's DDL
  generator (`Letflow.Entities.Definition.DDL.generate_table_ddl/3`,
  `unique_constraint_clauses/1`) and REQ-297's promotion executor
  (`execute_add_column/4`, extended from `execute_add_column/3`;
  `execute_create_table/1`, unchanged) — no new per-tenant-DDL-execution
  code path. Adds exactly one new DDL-issuing function,
  `run_constraint_activation/1`, using the identical `Repo.query!/1` +
  `rescue` shape and the identical per-tenant `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
  critical section `run_column_promotion/1` already establishes, so a
  constraint activation and a column promotion against the same tenant
  schema never interleave.

  `resolve_schema_name/1`).

  This is the mechanism `docs/migration/decisions/0003-ecto-schema-strategy.md`'s
  2026-08-17 addendum names: a context module about to write a tenant-scoped

  The designated tenant-scoped subset of `priv/repo/migrations/` —
  `replay_migrations/2`'s default `migration_source`. REQ-022 itself
  contributes zero entries (its own `CreateTenantSchemas` migration is
  global-only, see the migration's header comment); REQ-023 contributes the six
  event-store migrations (`lib/letflow/design/req023-event-store-schema.md` §4),
  REQ-024 the `event_type_registry` migration
  (`lib/letflow/design/req024-event-type-registry.md` §3), REQ-027 the two
  definition-core migrations, `process_definitions` and
  `instance_definition_snapshots`
  (`lib/letflow/design/req027-definition-core-schema.md` §4), REQ-035 the
  `promotion_reviews` migration
  (`lib/letflow/design/req035-promotion-reviews-schema.md` §4), REQ-040 the
  `promotion_assertion_runs` migration
  (`lib/letflow/design/req040-promotion-assertion-rerun.md` §4), REQ-043 three
  more: the `instance_projections` engine-columns `ALTER TABLE`, `tokens`, and
  `tasks` (`lib/letflow/design/req043-instance-engine-schema.md` §7), REQ-063
  three more: `groups`, `tenant_role`, and `users` moved behind schema-per-tenant
  (`lib/letflow/design/req063-identity-tables-schema-per-tenant.md` §2/§3),
  REQ-064 ten more: the `tenant_id`-drop migrations for `events`,
  `events_archive`, `instance_projections`, `process_definitions`, `tokens`,
  `tasks`, `promotion_reviews`, `promotion_assertion_runs`, `users`, and
  `groups` (`lib/letflow/design/req064-drop-tenant-id.md` §2), and REQ-054 one
  more: `instance_state_snapshots`
  (`lib/letflow/design/req054-instance-state-snapshots.md` §3), REQ-176 one
  more: `dlq_entries` (`lib/letflow/design/req176-dlq-core.md` §4), REQ-181
  one more: `webhook_subscriptions`
  (`lib/letflow/design/req181-webhooks-core.md` §1), REQ-186 one more:
  `timers` (`lib/letflow/design/req186-scheduler-core.md` §1), and REQ-183
  one more: `webhook_delivery_attempts`
  (`lib/letflow/design/req183-webhook-delivery-dispatch.md` §1) —
  entries in total (see `@tenant_scoped_migration_manifest` itself for the
  authoritative, up-to-date count), ordered by version. Every future tenant-scoped migration must append its
  own entry to `@tenant_scoped_migration_manifest`, in addition to following the
  required guard pattern in its own migration file (see this module's design doc
  §4) — a migration file that does one without the other is either inert
  (never selected here) or corrupts `public` on a plain `mix ecto.migrate` run
  (added here without the guard).

  **This function loads each listed migration module before returning it.**
  `Ecto.Migrator` resolves a `{version, module}` source through
  `load_migration!/1`, which requires `Code.ensure_loaded?(module)` to be true
  (`deps/ecto_sql/lib/ecto/migrator.ex`), but `priv/repo/migrations/*.exs` is
  never compiled into the application — `mix.exs` sets `elixirc_paths` to
  `["lib"]` (plus `test/support` under `:test`), so no `.beam` file exists for
  any migration module. Without this loading step `Ecto.Migrator.run/4` raises
  `Ecto.MigrationError: module ... is not an Ecto.Migration`, which
  `replay_migrations/2` surfaces as `{:error, {:migration_failed, exception}}`.

  That failure is state-dependent, which is why REQ-022 never hit it: only
  *pending* migrations reach `load_migration!/1`, and `mix.exs`'s `test:` alias
  runs `ecto.migrate` in the same VM, which defines pending migration modules via
  `Code.compile_file/1`. So the bug is invisible against a freshly-migrated test
  database and appears against an already-migrated one — and always appears in an
  `iex -S mix` session or a release, where `mix ecto.migrate` never ran in-process
  at all.

  `Code.require_file/1` is idempotent, and the `Code.ensure_loaded?/1` guard
  additionally covers the case where such a `mix ecto.migrate` run already
  defined the module in this VM — which `require_file/1` would not know about and
  would otherwise redefine, emitting a "redefining module" warning.

  This function's `@spec` is unchanged from REQ-022's: the return shape is still
  `[{version, module}]`, and the manifest's third element never escapes it.

  REQ-024's `event_type_registry` entry originally shipped in the bare
  `{version, module}` form and carried that same latent failure; routing it
  through the manifest here repairs it too, rather than leaving one entry
  loadable only by accident. Every entry added since — REQ-027's two — uses the
  three-element form for the same reason; reverting any of them to the bare
  `{version, module}` shape would reintroduce the defect.

  # Seeds 6 event_type_registry rows (REQ-045 §9 OQ-3a, extended by
  # ISS-0072/GH#257) -- only when replay_migrations/2 ran the real, default
  # production manifest (tenant_scoped_migrations/0), never when a caller
  # passed an explicit migration_source. This distinction matters: a
  # caller-supplied migration_source (test/support/req022_migration_fixture.ex's
  # own {1, MigrationFixture} case, exercised by
  # test/letflow/tenant_provisioning_test.exs) may not include
  # event_type_registry's own migration at all, so unconditionally seeding
  # here would attempt an insert against a table that doesn't exist in that
  # schema and turn an otherwise-passing replay into a crash.
  #
  # Why this lives in replay_migrations/2 and not provision_tenant_schema/1
  # (REQ-045's own design doc names both as candidate extension points):
  # event_type_registry is a tenant-scoped table created by a *migration*
  # (priv/repo/migrations/20260816163103_create_event_type_registry.exs),
  # replayed here via Ecto.Migrator.run/4 above -- it does not exist yet at
  # provision_tenant_schema/1's own point in a tenant's onboarding sequence
  # (that function only creates the bare Postgres schema and the
  # tenant_schemas registry row; migration replay is this module's own
  # moduledoc's "two separate, composable primitives" the caller sequences
  # itself). Seeding here, immediately after this same call's own
  # Ecto.Migrator.run/4 succeeds, is the earliest point the table is
  # guaranteed to exist.
  #
  # Idempotent by construction: Letflow.EventStore.Registry.register_type/2's
  # own (name, schema_version) collision -- {:error, :duplicate_event_type_version}
  # -- is treated as success here, for every entry in the list below, so a
  # second replay_migrations/2 call against an already-seeded tenant schema
  # (Ecto.Migrator.run/4 itself is already idempotent on re-applying
  # migrations) is also a no-op on this step for all 6 types, not a hard
  # failure.
  #
  # REQ-045's own OQ-3a was narrowly scoped to "INSTANCE_STARTED" (the one
  # event type EE-01's Letflow.Engine.create/2 actually appends). ISS-0072
  # (GH#257) found 5 additional event types with real production writers and
  # no registry row -- each was silently failing EventStore.append/2 with
  # {:error, :unknown_event_type} -- and they are seeded here too:
  # "TASK_COMPLETED" (Letflow.Engine.complete_task/3), "INSTANCE_CANCELLED"
  # (Letflow.Engine.cancel_instance/3), "INSTANCE_PINS_REBOUND"
  # (Letflow.Engine.PinRebind.rebind_pins/3), "SUB_PROCESS_COMPLETED"
  # (Letflow.Engine.SubProcess's sub-process completion path), and
  # "EXECUTION_ERROR" (Letflow.Engine.ExecutionError.append_execution_error_event/2).
  #
  # "DEFINITION_PROMOTED", "DEFINITION_VERSION_ROLLED_BACK", and
  # "PROMOTION_ASSERTION_TEARDOWN_FAILED" (REQ-140) now have production
  # writers: the three Letflow.EventStore.PlatformEvents adapter functions
  # (append_definition_promoted/2, append_definition_version_rolled_back/2,
  # append_promotion_assertion_teardown_failed/2) built by REQ-140, each
  # satisfying Letflow.Definitions's event_appender_fun/0 contract. Nothing
  # yet calls those functions from a live route -- wiring opts[:event_appender]
  # defaults into REQ-077's ported promotion routes is that requirement's
  # job, not this one's.

  # REQ-297 -- entity column-promotion executor
  #
  # See lib/letflow/design/req297-entity-promotion-executor.md for the full
  # design this section implements, and
  # docs/migration/decisions/0024-entity-promotion-ddl-execution.md for the
  # decision it's built from. This section implements all four of 0024's
  # sub-answers:
  #
  #   1. THE MECHANISM: this module (Letflow.TenantProvisioning), extended --
  #      not a second module -- issuing `ALTER TABLE`/`CREATE TABLE`
  #      directly against a tenant's own Postgres schema.
  #   2. PARTIAL-FAILURE: per-tenant, tracked one row per
  #      (tenant_id, entity_type, attribute) in `entity_column_promotions`
  #      (Letflow.TenantProvisioning.ColumnPromotion) -- a promotion is NOT
  #      atomic across tenants; each tenant's row succeeds or fails on its
  #      own, and repair is a retry of that one row
  #      (retry_failed_column_promotion/1), never a whole-batch re-run.
  #   3. BACKFILL: a replay through
  #      Letflow.Entities.Record.Projector.rebuild_projection/2 (never an
  #      inline UPDATE), with dual-write into the per-entity-type table kept
  #      current for the whole ddl_applied..backfilled window
  #      (column_promotion_dual_write?/3, wired into
  #      Letflow.Entities.Records's write path below).
  #   4. ROLLBACK: suspend_column_promotion/2 flips `query_eligible` to
  #      `false` (query-layer exclusion) while leaving `status` at `"active"`
  #      -- this executor has no code path that drops or narrows a column;
  #      "rollback" here means "stop querying it," never "undo the DDL."

  Whether `column_name` physically exists on `table_name` in the tenant
  schema named by `schema_name` -- the column-granularity counterpart to
  `entity_table_exists?/2` above, same idiom exactly (parameterised SQL
  against `information_schema.columns`, `Repo.query!/2`, `rows == []` ->
  `false`).

  REQ-300 rework cycle 3 (SECURITY-REVIEWER-reported regression): a
  per-entity-type table can exist while a *specific* declared-but-never-
  promoted column on it does not (0023's additive-declare-then-promote
  rule allows a definition to declare a new `queried: true` field or
  `fk_def` after the table already exists from an earlier promotion).
  Checking only `entity_table_exists?/2` is table-granularity and
  therefore insufficient to decide whether one particular column is safe
  to reference as a real Postgres identifier -- this function is the
  shared, single implementation of the column-granularity check, called
  by both `Letflow.Entities.Query.Allowlist.load/2` (gating `:typed_column`
  classification per candidate promoted column name, so a
  declared-but-unpromoted field falls back to the always-safe
  `:json_field`/JSONB path instead) and
  `Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler.relation_column_exists?/3` (which
  delegates here rather than duplicating this query, for the join-path's
  own declaring-side check). Colocated with `entity_table_exists?/2`
  rather than in either caller, since both callers already depend on this
  module for table-existence and neither should own physical-schema
  introspection that the other also needs.

  tenant. `:all` resolves via `list_registrations/0` at call time (this

  one). `column_spec.pg_type` is supplied by the caller from
  `Letflow.Entities.Definition.DDL.field_type_to_pg_type/1` applied to the
  promoted `field_def()` -- this function does not re-derive the type
  mapping. `column_spec.nullable` is always treated as `true`, per 0023's
