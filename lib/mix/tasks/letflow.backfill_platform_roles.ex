  @moduledoc """
  Backfills `Letflow.Identity.RoleRegistry.seed_default_platform_role_groups/1`
  (the seven (REQ-447: `PLATFORM_ADMIN` only in the platform tenant) `Letflow.Api.Authorization.roles/0` platform-role bindings) for
  every tenant registered in `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.list_registrations/0`.

  ISS-0778 (2026-09-22) started seeding these bindings automatically at
  tenant-creation time, but nothing ever re-ran that seeding for a tenant
  provisioned *before* ISS-0778 shipped — such a tenant has no route to get
  the missing bindings later, and every non-admin OIDC user on it reads
  `roles: []` and gets 403 everywhere (`docs/issues/ISS-0886.yaml`). This
  task closes that gap, once, for every such tenant.

  ## Usage

      mix letflow.backfill_platform_roles

  No arguments. Targets whatever `MIX_ENV`/`Letflow.Repo` config is active —
  no `LETFLOW_DEV_DB_CONFIRMED` guard, unlike `mix letflow.seed`, since this
  task is explicitly meant to be run against QA/staging, not only a dev box
  (same precedent as `mix letflow.backfill_event_type_versions`, which also
  has no such guard).

  Idempotent — safe to re-run against a database where some or all tenants
  already have all of their bindings; re-running converges rather than erroring
  or duplicating rows (`Letflow.Identity.RoleBackfill`'s own moduledoc).

  Exits non-zero if any tenant fails to backfill.
