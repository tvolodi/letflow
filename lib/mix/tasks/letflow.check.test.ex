  ISS-0069 Part 2 (revised): the `test` step used by `mix letflow.check`.

  ISS-0428: shells out to `scripts/test_parallel.sh` (via `bash`) instead of plain
  `mix test` -- the parallel runner N-way partitions the suite (N derived from
  `TEST_PARALLEL_N`/`nproc`/`getconf`, never hardcoded here; see the script's own
  header and `docs/migration/decisions/0009-test-parallel-pool-sizing.md`), which
  measured 1.89x on CI's actual 2-vCPU parallelism and up to ~5x on a 16-core dev
  host (see `lib/letflow/design/iss0428-parallel-runner-in-check-test.md` section 0).
  No `mix.exs`/`ci.yml` edit is needed for CI to pick this up: CI's only backend gate
  is `mix letflow.check`, which already calls this task (REQ-136).

  The runner's own stdout only ever carries per-partition summary lines and an
  aggregated total -- never the constituent partitions' raw test output. So the
  ISS-0069 substring check below does **not** read that aggregate stream. It parses
  the runner's `test_parallel: partition logs in <dir>` line (printed unconditionally
  once the runner reaches its partition-launch step), discovers every
  `partition-*.log` file under that directory (no hardcoded partition count), and
  applies the substring check to their concatenated content -- see design doc
  section 1 for the full rationale, including why pointing this check at the
  aggregate stdout instead would make it an unreliable gate (sometimes catching a
  warning, sometimes not, depending on Mix's compile-manifest re-emission behavior)
  rather than a reliably vacuous one.

  If the log-dir line is absent/unparseable, or zero partition logs are found, this
  task hard-fails (`Mix.raise`) rather than silently passing -- a future edit to
  `scripts/test_parallel.sh` that removes or reworks that output contract must break
  this gate loudly, never silently stop gating.

  **Ordering rule** (design doc section 1.2 step 1): when the runner exits nonzero
  AND the log-dir line is absent, this task reports the runner's nonzero exit first,
  not "log line missing" -- the common real case is a `mix compile` failure inside
  `test_parallel.sh`'s own pre-compile step, which exits before the log-dir line is
  ever printed, and leading with "log line missing" would send a reader hunting a
  nonexistent parsing bug instead of the real compile error.

  **Full failure detail, either failure mode** (design doc section 4): on a failing run, this task prints
  the full content of every partition log that shows real test failures (a `Failed:`
  line) or a crash (no `Result:` line) before raising, so an agent reading the
  terminal/CI job log sees the actual failing test's detail without needing the
  runner's own `mktemp -d` directory to still exist.

  ISS-0352: after the main suite passes, this task runs the `:wasm_hang`-tagged tests
  in `test/letflow/engine/wasm/` -- tests that deliberately, genuinely hang a real
  `wasmex` NIF call to prove REQ-170's own live-verified finding that no BEAM-side
  mechanism can reclaim that thread -- it permanently occupies one slot of `wasmex`'s
  shared, node-global native worker pool for the rest of the OS process. Run in the
  same process as every other WASM NIF test, this starved unrelated tests once the
  pool was exhausted (PR #691, then worse on PR #692 -- 18 cascading
  `ExUnit.TimeoutError`s).

  ISS-0418: a single shared subprocess for every `:wasm_hang` test (this task's
  original ISS-0352 shape) does not actually solve the hazard above -- it only moves
  it: every `:wasm_hang` test permanently wedges one native worker thread in whatever
  subprocess it runs in, so a single shared subprocess still accumulates one leaked
  thread per test and exhausts a small-CPU-count runner's pool by the last test or
  two (post-fix CI still showed the same ~50% flake rate as before,
  `docs/issues/ISS-0418.yaml`). The fix (see
  `lib/letflow/design/iss0418-wasm-hang-test-isolation-fix.md`, ELIXIR-DEV-owned) is
  per-test process isolation: `discover_wasm_hang_tests/0` runs `mix test --only
  wasm_hang --dry-run` to ask ExUnit itself which `{file, line}` pairs are currently
  tagged (never hardcoded -- adding/removing a `:wasm_hang` test anywhere is picked
  up automatically), then `run_wasm_hang_tests/0` spawns one real, fresh subprocess
  per discovered location via `mix test <file>:<line>` -- deliberately **without**
  `--only wasm_hang` (design doc §4.1: verified live that `--only` is silently
  discarded when combined with `<file>:<line>`, and `<file>:<line>` alone already
  bypasses `test/test_helper.exs`'s default `:wasm_hang` exclusion, so the suffix
  would be a no-op). A fresh OS subprocess means a fresh BEAM node and therefore a
  fresh, unleaked native thread pool, by construction -- no test ever shares a
  process (and therefore an accumulating pool) with another `:wasm_hang` test.
  Running under N-way parallelism would still multiply the per-process hazard, so
  every per-test subprocess stays serial, same as before.

  ISS-0426: this task then runs a THIRD subprocess, `mix test --only
  lua_wallclock_race`, also unchanged and serial -- these tests need to run without
  racing 30+ concurrently-scheduled siblings for wall-clock-sensitive timing (see
  `lib/letflow/design/iss426-wallclock-test-contention.md` section 2.3). ISS-0423
  already recorded that parallel running is exactly what surfaces this flake, so
  putting these inside a parallel partition would reintroduce the contention they
  were isolated to remove.

  Unlike a blanket `test --warnings-as-errors`, this task does **not** fail
  on every warning. `docs/issues/ISS-0044.yaml` (`status: resolved`)
  already diagnosed two warning classes that only ever surface under
  `mix test` (never under `mix compile --warnings-as-errors`) as
  permanently deferred, not fixed:

    * `ExUnit.Case.register_test/4 is deprecated` (ISS-0044 Group 1) --
      blocked on a `stream_data` 0.6.0 -> up to 1.4.0 version bump.
    * `redefining module ... CreateEventTypeRegistry` (ISS-0044 Group 3) --
      a deliberate, documented `Code.require_file/1` test workaround.

  Blanket `--warnings-as-errors` fails on both regardless of this issue's
  fix, so this task instead gates narrowly on ISS-0069's own class: an
  unused default value on an optional `defp` argument in a test helper,
  whose compiler warning always starts with the fixed, stable substring
  `"default values for the optional arguments"` (see
  `lib/letflow/design/iss0069-unused-default-warnings-fix.md`).

  ## Exit-code contract

    * Exits `0` only if the parallel runner's own aggregated result is a real pass
      (every partition has a `Result:` line, zero parsed failures) **and** the
      target substring is absent from every partition log **and** the
      `:lua_wallclock_race` isolated subprocess exits `0` clean **and** the
      `:wasm_hang` discovery subprocess succeeds and every one of the N per-test
      `:wasm_hang` subprocesses it discovers exits `0` clean.
    * Exits `1` if the runner, the `:lua_wallclock_race` subprocess, the `:wasm_hang`
      discovery subprocess, or any of the N per-test `:wasm_hang` subprocesses
      reports a real failure, regardless of the substring check.
    * Exits `1` if the runner or the `:lua_wallclock_race` subprocess exits `0` but
      the target substring is present anywhere in the relevant captured/log output
      (with partition attribution for the main suite), or if the target substring is
      present in the concatenation of the N `:wasm_hang` per-test subprocess
      outputs -- printing the offending line(s) so the failure is immediately
      actionable.

  Every other warning class (including the two ISS-0044 classes above, and
  the separately out-of-scope unused `tenant` variable) remains visible in
  the streamed output but never affects this task's exit code.

      mix letflow.check.test

  No arguments -- invoked from the `letflow.check` alias. `run/1` accepts
  and ignores the arg list Mix passes, matching the standard `Mix.Task`

  # DEVIATION FROM DESIGN DOC (documented, not silent -- see handoff): §4.2 step 2
  # specifies taking the block "up to the next blank line or a line that does not
  # match the file:line shape," implying the test-list lines are contiguous
  # immediately after the header. Live-verified this session (5 consecutive real
  # `mix test --only wasm_hang --dry-run` runs against the full, uncached test
  # suite) that this assumption does not hold in practice: ExUnit's own
  # non-deterministic compiler-warning emission for OTHER, unrelated test files
  # (re-diagnosed every run, seemingly regardless of compile-manifest cache state)
  # interleaves directly between the header and the actual file:line entries, and
  # sometimes between individual entries. A strict `take_while` that stops at the
  # first non-matching line would therefore intermittently discover 0 tests and
  # hard-fail (per this task's own "never silently proceed with zero" discipline)
  # even though 5 real :wasm_hang tests exist -- a false negative, not a true
  # "discovery broken" case. This implementation instead FILTERS every line in the
  # bounded window between the header and the terminator for the file:line shape,
  # which is robust to warning interleaving inside that window while still bounding
  # the scan to the correct section of output (never scanning the whole stream).
