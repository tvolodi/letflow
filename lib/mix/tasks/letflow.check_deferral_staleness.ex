  Implements ISS-0258: deferral-staleness detection.

  `mix letflow.check_requirements_registration` (ISS-0231) classifies every
  requirement into `:registered | :deferred | :neither | :unclassified`, and
  its only rule touching `:deferred` is R3 -- fires exactly when the
  rationale is `nil` or `""`. Its roster header states the contract in
  words: *"DEFERRED (visible debt -- always reported, never gates)"*.

  So *any* non-empty rationale satisfies R3 forever. There is no time
  dimension and no re-evaluation against the world. A requirement deferred
  with a once-true reason stays green after that reason stops being true.
  That is the ISS-0221 failure mode -- a validated-looking requirement
  `get_next_task` never returns, whose only symptom is an idle pipeline --
  displaced one layer up. `UNREGISTERED` is now watched; **`DEFERRED` is
  the state nothing watches.**

  The root cause is not a bug in ISS-0231's logic. It is a **missing
  invariant**: the project has a written rule for *whether a deferral is
  documented* and no rule at all for *whether a deferral is still
  justified*. Free text is unfalsifiable by construction. This task adds
  the missing half.

  ## What "stale" means -- the activity derivation

  Stage activity is **not a readable field**. A `stages:` entry carries
  `id`, `name`, `description`, `depends_on`, `detail_file` and no status of
  any kind, so activity must be *derived* from the per-requirement
  `status:` values of the requirements assigned to that stage:

  > A stage is `:active` iff at least one requirement assigned to it --
  > **excluding the requirement currently under test** -- has a status in
  > `#{inspect([:done, :in_progress, :blocked])}`. `:pending` and
  > `:cancelled` do not confer activity. `:unknown` confers nothing and
  > separately hard-fails.

  Status by status, and why:

    * `:done` -- **active**. Work in the stage completed, so the stage is
      demonstrably underway. Removing `:done` from the set makes the whole
      derivation vacuous and reproduces ISS-0258 *inside its own fix*.
    * `:in_progress` -- **active**, definitionally.
    * `:blocked` -- **active**. `blocked` is not reachable from the initial
      state without someone starting the work and recording an impediment;
      that is engagement, not idleness. The error costs are also
      asymmetric: a missed stale deferral is silent and unfalsifiable (the
      whole reason this issue exists), while a false positive is loud,
      named by `REQ-NNN`, printed with its witnesses, and closable in one
      line.
    * `:pending` -- **not active**. The initial state carries no
      information that work began. Counting it would make every stage that
      has any requirement at all active, flagging every deferral that has
      ever been written.
    * `:cancelled` -- **not active. Abandonment is not activity.** Measured
      rather than asserted: S8 held `1 cancelled + 10 pending` when the
      project's 21 historical deferrals existed, so counting `cancelled`
      would have flipped 9 known-good deferrals from legitimate to stale.

  A stage with **no** requirements is `:inactive` by the same rule, not by
  a special case: the empty set contains no active status.

  ### Self-exclusion

  The entry under test is excluded from its own stage's activity set.
  Without it, a deferred requirement that is itself `done` would activate
  its own stage and flag itself -- an unfixable red. This is not gameable:
  the exclusion is of *the entry under test from its own computation*, not
  of deferred entries generally, so two deferred entries in one stage do
  not mutually excuse each other. The one case it deliberately declines to
  judge -- a lone deferred entry that is itself `done`/`in_progress`/
  `blocked` -- is *annotated* on the roster and never gated, because that
  anomaly is registration-shaped, not staleness-shaped.

  ## The escape hatch: `blocked-by: REQ-NNN`

  A deferral scoped to a sibling *requirement* rather than to a whole stage
  is legitimate inside an active stage, and a bare stage-activity rule
  would flag it. The hatch is a recognised scope prefix parsed out of the
  existing rationale text -- no new field, no schema change:

      # impl_order: UNREGISTERED -- blocked-by: REQ-042 -- <free-text rationale>

  Four properties, each load-bearing, plus acyclicity:

    * **Anchored to the start of the rationale.** An unanchored match would
      let prose that merely *mentions* the form activate the hatch.
    * **The named id must exist in the corpus** (S3). A dangling reference
      would be a permanent unfalsifiable suppression -- this issue again.
    * **The blocker's status is checked, and the hatch expires** (S3). If
      the blocker is `done` or `cancelled` the deferral is stale again. The
      hatch is not an exemption; it is a machine-checkable assertion that
      goes stale on its own. Self-reference is rejected for the same
      reason.
    * **Free text after the hatch is still required**, so R3's spirit -- a
      human-readable reason -- survives the hatch rather than being
      replaced by it.
    * **The hatch graph must be acyclic** (S6). `REQ-A -- blocked-by:
      REQ-B` together with `REQ-B -- blocked-by: REQ-A` satisfies all four
      properties above and *never expires*, precisely because neither
      member can reach `done` or `cancelled` while it waits on the other.
      A cycle is an exception list of size >= 2 written in rationale text.

  ## Rules (any violation => non-zero exit)

    * **S1** -- no deferred requirement is STALE. A deferral is stale when
      its stage is active (self-excluded) and it carries no *live*
      `blocked-by:` scope. The message names the entry, its line, its
      stage, and the sibling ids/statuses that made the stage active.
    * **S2** -- every deferred requirement carries a `stage:`. Absent stage
      => staleness is undecidable => violation. Not a silent pass; a silent
      exemption is the failure class this task exists to remove.
    * **S3** -- a `blocked-by:` scope resolves and is live. Violated when
      the named id is absent from the corpus, is the entry's own id, or
      names a requirement that is `done` or `cancelled`.
    * **S4** -- every requirement's status is a recognised value.
      `:unknown` hard-fails, naming the entry and the offending raw token.
      This is the totality defence transplanted from ISS-0231's R2:
      silently treating an unrecognised status as inactive would let a typo
      (`status: donee`) un-activate a stage and make a stale deferral look
      legitimate. Applied to **all** entries, not only deferred ones.
    * **S5** -- the corpus is non-empty and shaped: at least one entry, and
      at least one recognised status. A scan that finds nothing is never a
      silent green pass. This deliberately duplicates part of the
      registration check's R5: this module must be correct on its own, not
      correct only because another task ran first.
    * **S6** -- the `blocked-by:` graph over deferred entries is acyclic.
      The one-step case (self-reference) is S3's; S6 is the >= 2-step case
      and it is the same defect. The message names every id on the cycle,
      in order.

  ## Always printed, never gating

  The **stage-activity table** (each stage, its status histogram, the
  derived verdict and the witness ids) so the derivation is auditable
  rather than hidden inside an exit code, and the **deferral roster**
  (every deferred entry with its stage, scope, verdict and the one-line
  reason for that verdict).

  **`:legitimate` deferrals never influence the exit code, at any count.**
  ISS-0231's visible-debt principle is preserved exactly; only its
  never-expiring half changes. Documented-and-still-true stays free.
  Documented-but-no-longer-true now fails.

  This module ships with **no exception list of any kind** -- no
  grandfathering, no wildcard, no id allowlist, no prefix suppression. It
  is green on `main` at the moment it lands (measured: 0 deferrals and 0
  unknown statuses of 115 entries), so any future red is a new fact.

  ## Why this is a separate task, not an extension

  1. **Different data shape.** Registration state is decidable from one
     entry's own lines. Staleness needs a cross-entry aggregate -- every
     sibling's status in the same stage -- which no per-entry classifier
     can express.
  2. **Different gating semantics.** The registration module's moduledoc
     contracts, in words, that *"The deferred count never influences the
     exit code, at any value."* A staleness rule must gate. Adding a gating
     rule on the deferred bucket inside that module would contradict its
     own written contract.
  3. **Different failure class** -- "never registered" vs.
     "registered-adjacent staleness".
  4. **Different inputs, therefore different blast radius on a red run.**
     One exit code covering two independent invariants forces the reader to
     disambiguate which one broke before knowing whether the file changed
     or the world did.

  Exactly **one parser** exists for `docs/requirements.yaml` across both
  tasks: `Mix.Tasks.Letflow.CheckRequirementsRegistration.scan/1`. A second
  parser would drift into its own form-blindness, which is ISS-0231's root
  cause recurring by duplication.

  ## What this task never does

  It never writes to `docs/requirements.yaml`, never assigns or suggests an
  `impl_order`, never edits a `status`, and makes no network call -- in
  particular none to letflow-queue. It is a read-only auditor.

  It scans `docs/requirements.yaml` **only** -- never `lib/`, never a
  directory walk. That is deliberate: this moduledoc itself contains both
  the deferral marker form and the hatch grammar it recognises, so a
  directory-wide scan would make the module fail its own check
  (`docs/anti-patterns.md`, "A grep-shaped acceptance criterion can be
  tripped by the module's own moduledoc describing the invariant").

  ## Usage

      mix letflow.check_deferral_staleness

  Wired into the `letflow.check` alias immediately after
  `letflow.check_requirements_registration` -- adjacent to its data source,
  and after it because if the file's *shape* broke, R2/R6 must be the first
  error the reader sees. A check nobody runs is not a check, and this
  repository has no CI configuration of any kind, so `mix letflow.check` is
  the only gate surface there is.

  Exits `0` iff S1-S6 all hold; `Mix.raise/1` otherwise, naming every
  violating entry by exact `REQ-NNN` and rule id.
