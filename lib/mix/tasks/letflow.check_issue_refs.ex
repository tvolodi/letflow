  @moduledoc """
  Enforces `docs/agents/protocols/ISSUE_QUEUE.md`'s "Numbering schema"
  section: three registries number independently from 1, so every
  cross-reference must carry its registry's prefix.

      id: ISS-0030          # local record (docs/issues/)
      queue_ref: Q-76       # letflow-queue task
      github_ref: GH-89     # GitHub issue

  ## Why this exists as a gate rather than a convention

  The rule this schema replaces — "`ISS-0187` is queue task `187`" — was
  itself documented, in the same protocol file, and it decayed anyway. It
  was true for the window in which queue-allocated ids were the only source
  of new issue numbers, and nothing re-checked it once that stopped being
  so. Measured on 2026-09-09 it held for 172 of 305 files: 27 contradicted
  it outright and 104 predated the queue.

  A documented convention with no validating step is exactly what
  `docs/migration/decisions/0004-humanless-pipeline.md` says will drift.
  This task is that validating step, applied to the project's own
  conventions rather than to its code.

  ## Rules

    * **R1 — no bare-number cross-reference.** `github_ref: 89` and
      `queue_ref: 76` are violations; the registry is part of the value.
      A bare number is the exact ambiguity the schema exists to remove.

    * **R2 — no superseded field name.** `github_issue`, `github_issue_number`
      and `queue_task_id` were normalised to `github_ref`/`queue_ref` across
      all 305 files in one pass. Reintroducing one re-splits the corpus into
      two shapes that every reader then has to handle.

    * **R3 — well-formed values.** A non-null `github_ref` matches `GH-<n>`
      and a non-null `queue_ref` matches `Q-<n>`, `<n>` being a positive
      integer with no leading zeros. A full GitHub URL is not a ref: it is
      the shape 139 files used before normalisation.

    * **R4 — `null` is explicit and explained.** `null` is legitimate and
      means "not in that registry" — a local-only finding, or one filed
      before the queue existed. It must carry a trailing comment saying
      which, so a reader can tell a deliberate absence from an omission.
      This is the same reasoning `check_requirements_registration` applies
      to a bare-missing `impl_order`.

    * **R5 — `id` matches the filename.** `docs/issues/ISS-0030.yaml` must
      declare `id: ISS-0030`. A file whose `id` is a placeholder such as
      `PENDING` is invisible to every registry at once.

  ## Parsing model

  Line-oriented, not YAML, matching `check_requirements_registration`'s own
  stated reasoning: this project has no YAML dependency, and adding one for
  a lint would be a library choice needing REVIEWER sign-off. Only
  **column-0** field lines are considered, which is what keeps prose
  mentions inside `description: >` blocks — where `queue_task_id: 128`
  legitimately appears as quoted history — from being read as identity
  fields. Commentary fields like `github_issue_note` are matched exactly,
  not by prefix, so they are unaffected.

  ## Usage

      mix letflow.check_issue_refs

  Wired into the `letflow.check` alias alongside the other fast,
  non-compiling scans. Exits `0` iff R1-R5 all hold; `Mix.raise/1`
  otherwise, naming every violating file and rule id.
