defmodule Mix.Tasks.Letflow.LintHandoffs do
  @shortdoc "Validates every handoffs/**/*.json against HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md's schema"

  @moduledoc """
  Implements ISS-0191: the handoff linter `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`'s Enforcement
  note has described as a known gap since the protocol was written. Mirrors,
  for Letflow, what R-Co's `tools/lint_handoffs.py` does for R-Co (schema
  conformance, timestamp monotonicity, registry coverage), adopted after a
  2026-08-05 R-Co audit found unenforced bookkeeping rules were followed at
  0.4-8.6% compliance despite being written down.

  A plain Mix task, not a shell script: this project already has precedent
  (`mix letflow.check_toolchain`, `mix letflow.check_test`) and JSON decoding
  needs `Jason`, a runtime dependency only reachable inside the compiled app
  -- unlike `scripts/timed_test.sh`, which is deliberately a shell script for
  an unrelated reason (measuring a genuinely cold `mix compile`; this task
  has no such constraint, so that precedent does not apply here).

  ## Checks

  ### Hard (exit non-zero on any un-grandfathered violation)

    * **H1** -- top-level `status` is one of the six legal values.
    * **H2** -- `completed_at` never precedes `started_at`, when both are set.
    * **H3** -- top-level keys are a subset of `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` §2's
      schema (`@schema_top_keys` below), or individually grandfathered.
    * **H4** -- when `not_agent_attested` is present, its member set is
      **exactly** the required six (or those six plus `backfill_note`), read
      live out of `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md` §4.1(b)'s own table -- not hardcoded
      here, so a future edit to that table is what the linter measures, not
      what it silently drifts away from (ISS-0203's own concern about this
      exact class of drift). `backfill_note` itself is legal on at most the
      one file §4.1(b) names as its single spent exception, extracted the
      same way.
    * **H5** -- registry coverage: every `run_id` implied by a
      `handoffs/<run_id>/` directory appears in `handoffs/registry.json`'s
      `runs[].run_id`, and vice versa.
    * **H6** -- every discovered handoff-shaped file (basename starts with
      `step`) is JSON. A non-`.json` file is a discovery-completeness defect
      in its own right. **Unlike H1-H4, H6 is not grandfathered by an
      explicit file list** -- a file whose content already existed in git
      history at or before `@h6_floor_commit` is automatically exempt
      (reported, does not fail the build); a file introduced after that
      floor always fails the build. See `@h6_floor_commit`'s own comment and
      `lib/letflow/design/iss0262-h6-floor-commit-addendum.md` for why.

  A hard violation on a file not in this module's grandfather maps is a
  **new** regression and fails the run. A hard violation on a grandfathered
  file is reported (so the debt stays visible) but does not fail the run --
  each grandfathered file is named individually, dated, and traced to
  ISS-0190, per that issue's "no blanket suppression" requirement. This
  module contains **no wildcard or pattern-based grandfathering, with one
  exception: H6**, which is governed by the `@h6_floor_commit`
  commit-boundary rule instead of a per-file list -- see above. Every other
  hard rule's grandfathering always means naming one exact path.

  ### Advisory (WARN or INFO; never change the exit code)

    * **H-SIZE-1/2/3** -- specified in `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`'s Enforcement
      note ("Specified but NOT YET RUNNING" section, added by ISS-0198, the
      `result.summary` figures added by ISS-0200). Implemented here exactly
      per that spec: H-SIZE-1 (cite-and-restate), H-SIZE-2 (under-specified),
      H-SIZE-3 (per-run report, includes ISS-0200's `result.summary`
      figures -- report-only, no threshold, no pass/fail, per that issue's
      own ruling).
    * **artifacts_out self-reference** (ISS-0202) -- WARN when a handoff's
      `result.artifacts_out` lists its own file (by basename, or either path
      a suffix of the other). Applies only to handoffs created at or after
      the commit that landed ISS-0202's rule (`@artifacts_out_rule_commit`
      below) -- the 201 pre-existing self-referencing files are historical
      and are not, and must not be, flagged; see `HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`'s
      `result.artifacts_out does not include the handoff's own file`
      subsection for why.

  ## What this task deliberately does NOT check

  Whether a `result` block was actually attested by its acting agent, rather
  than reconstructed after that agent died. That property exists in no
  artefact on disk, so it is structurally unfalsifiable from the files this
  task reads -- asserting it would be a green run of a different, fictional
  test. This task only checks that a *present* `not_agent_attested` marker is
  internally well-formed (H4); a file that omits the marker without needing
  one and a file that omits it while needing one are indistinguishable here,
  by design, per ISS-0191's own scope note.

  ## Usage

      mix letflow.lint_handoffs
      mix letflow.lint_handoffs --dir <path>
      mix letflow.lint_handoffs --autofix
      mix letflow.lint_handoffs --autofix --dir <path>

  Exits non-zero (`Mix.raise/1`) iff at least one un-grandfathered hard
  violation exists. WARN/INFO output goes to stdout and never affects the
  exit code.

  ### `--dir <path>` (ISS-0440)

  Overrides the directory scanned, in place of the hardcoded `@handoffs_dir`
  default. With no `--dir` given at all (CI's own invocation, via the
  `letflow.check` alias in `mix.exs`), the scanned directory is exactly
  `@handoffs_dir` -- unchanged from before this flag existed. Every run,
  with or without `--dir`, prints a banner naming the directory actually
  scanned and the file count found there, so a scoped run is never
  mistaken for a full-corpus result from output alone. An explicitly
  supplied `--dir` that discovers zero files is a hard usage error (raises,
  non-zero exit) rather than a silent "0 violations" success -- this
  carve-out does not apply to the default `@handoffs_dir` itself, since a
  genuinely empty real `handoffs/` is a separate, pre-existing edge case,
  not a `--dir` misuse symptom.

  ### `--autofix` (ISS-0440)

  Applies a closed, three-entry correction map to each file's top-level
  `status`: `"PASS"`, `"COMPLETE"`, and `"DONE"` are rewritten in place to
  `"COMPLETED"` and reported as fixed. `"FAIL"` and every other
  missing/non-string/unrecognized value are refused -- left untouched,
  reported by path and by the literal value found, and still counted as a
  hard violation for exit-code purposes. `--autofix` never guesses at an
  ambiguous status; it only ever acts on the three values with zero
  historical counterexamples. Combining `--autofix` with the default
  directory (i.e. omitting `--dir`, or passing `--dir handoffs`) runs the
  same restricted correction over the real handoff corpus -- this is
  intended, not restricted away, and every fixed file is reported so the
  action is never silent.

  # (mod whitespace) by `:` is a KEY candidate -- this is a purely
  # syntactic rule, not alternating-parity bookkeeping, so it cannot desync
  # on an odd/malformed structure. Only a depth-1 KEY whose *decoded*
  # content equals exactly "status" is a candidate; a nested `result.status`
  # (or any `status` key at depth >= 2) is scanned over but never a
  # candidate, by construction, regardless of where it appears in the file
  # -- this is what structurally rules out the PASS/PASS collision
  # ISSUE-FIXER demonstrated on a real fixture. If more than one depth-1
  # `status` key exists (a malformed/duplicate-key document), the FIRST one
  # found wins and every later depth-1 `status` match is ignored -- this
  # matches `Jason.decode/1`'s own confirmed FIRST-key-wins duplicate-key
  # semantics (verified directly against the pinned `jason 1.4.5`:
  # `Jason.decode!(~s({"status":"a","status":"b"}))` returns
  # `%{"status" => "a"}`, not `"b"`), so the span this scan edits is
  # guaranteed to be the same member `autofix_file/1`'s `Map.get(data,
  # "status")` actually acted on. (An earlier version of this comment
  # claimed the opposite -- last-key-wins -- which was false; see ISS-0457
  # for the correction.)
  #
  # Raises if no depth-1 "status" key is found -- an internal invariant
  # violation, not a normal refusal path: it can only happen if `raw`'s
  # structure disagrees with what `Jason.decode/1` already reported
  # earlier in `autofix_file/1` on this same `raw`, which should never
  # occur for valid JSON. Deliberately does NOT fall back to the old
  # whole-document re-encode on this failure -- that would silently
  # reintroduce the exact bug ISS-0442 is about.
