# REQ-328, provenance choice (a): pack.json IS committed, and this script is
# the only thing that may write it. See priv/packs/bilimbaga/README.md for why
# (a) was chosen over (b), and
# test/letflow/packs/bilimbaga_pack_install_test.exs's drift guard, which
# re-reads the ten source files and asserts each embedded definition_json is
# structurally equal to its source -- so a hand-edit of pack.json fails the
# suite.
#
# Run with:  MIX_ENV=test mix run priv/packs/bilimbaga/generate_pack.exs
#
# Pure content assembly. Reads no database and writes nothing but pack.json.

# Authoring order in the emitted array. This is NOT an install-ordering
# requirement -- install/3 writes :inactive metadata rows and emits no DDL, so
# it is order-insensitive. ACTIVATION order is what matters, and that is a
# separate concern documented in README.md and enforced by the install test's
# own @activation_order. This list is simply the dependency-sorted order, kept
# identical to the activation order so a reader of pack.json is not shown a
# second, conflicting ordering.
