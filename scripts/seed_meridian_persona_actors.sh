#
# Provisions the letflow-side (Part B) of the Meridian persona actors (ISS-0931):
#   - Creates process-routing role groups + tenant_role bindings for every role
#     referenced by the Meridian QA definitions (8 roles; role-committee-member dropped by ISS-1024, role-credit-approver-l1 added by ISS-1028 for l1-approval, the three committee votes now route to role-cro / role-credit-director / role-ceo)
#   - Adds each persona actor to TASK_WORKER (implicit) and to its role groups
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - curl and jq installed
#   - Part A done: Keycloak accounts actor-meridian-* exist and have synced into
#     letflow's users table (ai-dala-infra). Missing actor => abort naming it.
#   - QA_AUTH_TOKEN: Bearer token for a PLATFORM_ADMIN user in the meridian tenant
#       (GroupsManage + RolesManage + UsersManage).
#   - QA_URL: base URL (default: https://qa.bizdala.com)
#   - Run AFTER scripts/seed_meridian_definition.sh.
#
# Usage:
#   QA_AUTH_TOKEN="<token>" bash scripts/seed_meridian_persona_actors.sh
#
# Assumption: the persona -> role mapping comes from the scenario `actors:` blocks
# (test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/meridian/*.yaml) and
# test/fixtures/simulation/meridian/org_structure.yaml; thomas -> role-cro and
# eva -> role-ceo are inferred from org structure, not stated verbatim. Role groups
# are the authoritative part; a BA may amend the PERSONAS table only.
# TASK_WORKER is implicit for every persona and never listed below.
#
# Design: lib/letflow/design/iss0931-meridian-vortex-persona-actor-provisioning.md
