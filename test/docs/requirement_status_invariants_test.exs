defmodule Letflow.Docs.RequirementStatusInvariantsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  ISS-0119 regression test — the requirement run history stays readable,
  append-only, and schema-conformant.

  Specified by `lib/letflow/design/iss-0119-status-file-readability.md` §7
  (assertions A0–A11) and §7.1 (the fail-first demonstration). No database, no
  new dependencies; all helpers live in `Letflow.Test.StatusHistory`
  (`test/support/status_history.ex`) and take explicit paths.

  ## One `test` block per assertion — deliberate, not stylistic

  ExUnit aborts a block at its *first* failed assertion. A0 is **expected to
  fail** when this file is run against a pre-fix tree (there is no index there),
  and A3 is the fail-first proof. If A0 and A3 shared a block with A0 first, A3
  would never execute and the pre-fix run would short-circuit on the missing
  index — resurrecting the precise failure design §7.1 opens by rejecting.
  A0..A8 (and A3b) therefore each get their own block, and A3 is never preceded
  by A0 within a block. (REVIEWER ruling C3 at Step 3d; raised as MINOR M1 by
  CODE-DESIGN-VALIDATOR.)

  The fail-first evidence itself is recorded in `test/specs/ISS-0119.md`.

    A4b — ENTRY SHAPE DOES NOT AGREE WITH THE INDEX.

    An entry conforms when it carries exactly #{inspect(SH.entry_field_order())},
    in that order, with a parseable ISO-8601 `at:`. Exceptions live in the
    index's `known_shape_anomalies:` and must match disk EXACTLY, in BOTH
    directions (design §13.5).

    #{a4b_lines(findings.undeclared)}

      A `known_shape_anomalies:` record may cite ONLY a volume whose `volumes:`
      entry is `status: closed` with a `frozen_prefix_sha256:`. This fires on its
      own, independently of the two sets above, and even when the violation it
      cites genuinely exists on disk. A shape defect in the CURRENT volume is
      FIXED in the working tree before it is committed — it can never be declared
      away here, and neither deleting a record nor narrowing the detector is an
      available response (design §13.3, §13.5, §13.10).
