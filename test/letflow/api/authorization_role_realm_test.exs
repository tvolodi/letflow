defmodule Letflow.Api.AuthorizationRoleRealmTest do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-129 — proves the role set agrees between `Letflow.Api.Authorization`
  (the authorization matrix) and `priv/keycloak/realms/bpm-default.json`
  (the realm REQ-128 created), per `decisions/0013-authorization-role-set.md`.

  This is a *proving* test, not a reconciling one: it does not change either
  source. It reads the realm file's `roles.realm` list off disk and asserts
  it is exactly equal (same members, no more, no fewer) to
  `Letflow.Api.Authorization.roles/0`. Equality both directions is
  deliberate here — unlike the SPA-side check (`web/tests/guards/role-set.spec.ts`),
  there is no expected asymmetry between the matrix and the realm: per
  decision 0013, every realm Letflow authenticates against must define all
  five roles, `AGENT_RUNNER` included, so the realm can issue it even though
  no human user is seeded with it and the SPA never gates on it.

  A role added to or removed from either side alone must fail this test —
  see `authorization_ac9_test.exs` and `authorization_test.exs` for the
  matrix's own behavioral coverage; this file only checks the two sources
  stay in lockstep.
