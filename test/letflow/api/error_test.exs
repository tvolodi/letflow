  @moduledoc """
  Unit tests for `Letflow.Api.Error` (REQ-066, spec: `test/specs/REQ-066.md`).

  Pure — `Letflow.Api.Error` has no `Plug.Conn` dependency and no I/O, so per
  `docs/guides/test_developer_guide.md` §1 ("pure functions first") these are
  direct unit tests with no server and no database. The conn-threading half of
  REQ-066 lives in `test/letflow/api/response_test.exs`.

  Every assertion here is made against the **serialised JSON body**, not against
  the struct, so what is pinned is the wire contract a client actually receives.
