  ISS-0993 / ISS-0994 design section 10 (hardening H1) and section 12 item 10(a), 10(g) (spec
  `test/specs/ISS-0993-A2.md`): binding the `PLATFORM_ADMIN` name to a group is a PLATFORM-scope
  action. Platform authority rests on that binding, so a role that holds `:RolesManage`
  (`PROCESS_DESIGNER`) must not be able to rebind it, in any tenant.

  `POST /identity/roles` (here dispatched to `Letflow.Routers.Identity` as `POST /roles`):

    * `PROCESS_DESIGNER` of an ordinary tenant (A) and of the platform tenant (P): 403 for the name
      `PLATFORM_ADMIN` and every variant, for BOTH kinds (`platform_role`, `process_routing_role`);
    * `PLATFORM_ADMIN` of an ordinary tenant (A): the same 403 (it has `:RolesManage` but not platform
      scope);
    * `PLATFORM_ADMIN` of the platform tenant (P): unchanged success for the exact name as a
      `platform_role`; the variants are never accepted as a `platform_role` (the registry only knows
      the exact literal), see the last group of cases;
    * in every refused case no `tenant_role` row is written or changed and the 403 body names no role;
    * a name that is not a `PLATFORM_ADMIN` name stays allowed for `PROCESS_DESIGNER` (H1 does not
      over-block), and the platform tenant with no pin configured gives nobody platform scope.

  Unit level: `Letflow.Api.Authorization.platform_admin_name?/1` is pinned to
  `Authorization.roles_from_strings/1` (the parser that turns stored and token role strings into
  roles): for each of the six role literals they agree; any binary the parser maps to
  `:PLATFORM_ADMIN` is true; the defensive fold (trim, upper-case) catches case and whitespace
  variants; a non-binary is false.

  INV-10 check, enforced from the merge of Q-960 PR A. `async: false` (VM-global pin).
