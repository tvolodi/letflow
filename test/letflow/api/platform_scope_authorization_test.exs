  @moduledoc """
  ISS-0993 / ISS-0994 design section 12 item 3 and section 6 rule 1a (spec
  `test/specs/ISS-0993-A1.md`): the pure permission-scope surface of `Letflow.Api.Authorization`
  as shipped in A1 --

    * every core permission has exactly one scope (the scope table); the platform list is exact;
      Catalog (module) permissions are `:tenant`; any other atom is `:platform` (fail closed);
    * `has_permission_in_scope?/3` (REQ-447 PR 2: the C6 own-tenant switch is deleted, a non-platform
      tenant's `PLATFORM_ADMIN` confers nothing, tenant-scope included);
    * `evaluate_access/2` grid roles x `platform_tenant?` x keys, including the two catch-all
      marker keys (rule 1a);
    * `:Unknown` (A2 state): denied for every role, in and out of the platform tenant (see the
      test of that name below);
    * key and permission resolution for the new keys, table-driven.

  INV-10 check, enforced from the merge of Q-960 PR A (the scope-table completeness check).

  `async: false`: kept from the era when one test toggled the (now deleted) C6 application-config
  switch; the module no longer touches global state.
