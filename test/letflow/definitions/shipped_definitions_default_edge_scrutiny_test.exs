  ISS-0998 / Q-980 drift test: a decision's DEFAULT edge ("nothing above matched") must
  never lead to the same place as its "clear"-style branch when the gateway also has a
  manual-review branch -- an unknown or absent value would otherwise be treated as
  cleared and skip the review (the `e9-default` bug in the QA Meridian loan fixture:
  `kyc-routing` default -> `assessment-join`, same as `kyc_status == 'clear'`, skipping
  `kyc-manual-review`). The default must fail toward MORE scrutiny.

  The rule (deliberately conservative -- it only fires on this exact shape), per
  EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY node with a default edge:

    * review targets = targets of its non-default edges whose target node is a
      HUMAN_TASK whose id contains "review";
    * clear targets  = targets of its non-default edges whose condition compares a
      variable `== 'clear' | 'cleared' | 'approved' | 'pass' | 'passed' | 'ok'`,
      excluding any review target;
    * VIOLATION iff review targets are non-empty AND the default edge's target is one
      of the clear targets.

  Known blind spots (deliberate, to avoid false positives): a review node whose id lacks "review",
  or a clear-style condition phrased outside the regex above, is not detected here; the Meridian
  fixture test pins the kyc-routing shape by exact id/target/condition instead.

  ## ISS-1001 / Q-983 second rule: a default never leads to an irreversible action

  The `fallback-l2-approval` bug (Meridian loan, `l2-approval` -> `create-facility` with no
  condition: a missing/unrecognised/timed-out `l2_decision` created the loan = approval by
  default). Principle: defaults route toward MORE scrutiny and never toward the irreversible
  (approving / creating / paying out) branch. Per node `N` (any node type), an outgoing edge
  `E` is a *default-style edge* iff

    * `E.is_default == true`, OR
    * `E` has NO `condition` AND `N` has at least one OTHER outgoing edge WITH a condition
      (an unconditioned edge beside conditioned siblings is what the engine takes when none of
      them holds -- the `fallback-*` edges of the QA fixtures; a `timeout-*` edge counts only if its
      node also has a conditioned sibling, so the loan `timeout-*` paths via `assessment-join` are NOT covered).

  `E` is a VIOLATION iff it is default-style and its target node's id matches
  `@irreversible_target` (id starts with `create-`, `disburse-`, `release-`, `payout-`,
  `transfer-`, `execute-`, `activate-`, `provision-`, `refund-`, `issue-` or `archive-` (the
  last added by ISS-1018 for `archive-review`, which closes a review as signed off), or is
  exactly one of those words) -- ANY node type, so a SERVICE_TASK that creates/disburses and a HUMAN_TASK
  that disburses (`disburse-loan`) are both covered.

  ## ISS-1018 / Q-1000 third rule: a default never shares the target of an approve/close branch

  The `fallback-ceo-override` bug (Meridian regulatory review: `ceo-override` -> `archive-review`
  with no condition, the same target as `ceo_decision == 'sign_off'`: a missing/unrecognised
  decision closed the review without sign-off). A default-style edge (same definition as above)
  is a VIOLATION iff its target equals the target of a SIBLING conditioned edge whose condition
  compares a variable `== 'approve' | 'approved' | 'sign_off' | 'signed_off' | 'accept' |
  'accepted' | 'close' | 'closed'` (`@approving_condition`). Independent of the target's id, so it
  also catches approving defaults into nodes the id list above does not know. Blind spot: an
  approving condition phrased outside that regex (`>=`, `in`, `!=`) is not seen. Exception
  (BA-accepted, ISS-1001): a target that is a HUMAN_TASK is not a violation -- a default into a
  further human task is escalation to more scrutiny (`fallback-l1-approval` -> `l2-approval`, which
  shares its target with the `l1_decision == 'approve'` branch by design).

  Blind spots of the second rule (deliberate): an irreversible action whose id lacks those prefixes (e.g. `book-loan`,
  `ceo-approval`) is not detected -- approval HUMAN_TASKs (`*-approval`) are intentionally NOT in
  the list, because a default into a human approval task is escalation (more scrutiny), not the
  irreversible act itself; the action is judged by id only, not by the node's endpoint/attributes; a
  default reaching an irreversible node only INDIRECTLY (default -> X -> create-facility) is not
  followed (the direct edge is what ISS-1001 and its issue acceptance criteria name; the Meridian
  fixture test additionally graph-walks `l2-approval` with the real condition evaluator).

  Discovery is by structure over the same set as `ShippedDefinitionsValidationTest`
  (`priv/**/*.json`, `test/fixtures/qa/*.json`, `test/fixtures/simulation/**/process_*.yaml`).
