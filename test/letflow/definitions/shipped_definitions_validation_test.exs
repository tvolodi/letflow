defmodule Letflow.Definitions.ShippedDefinitionsValidationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-455 AC5: every process definition shipped in the repository or seeded by
  `scripts/` is run through the validator, so a definition with a dead end, an
  unreachable node or a decision without a default route cannot ship (the gap that
  reached UAT as ISS-0928).

  Discovery is by STRUCTURE, never a hand list, so a newly added fixture is covered
  without editing this file: every `priv/**/*.json`, `test/fixtures/qa/*.json` and
  `test/fixtures/simulation/**/process_*.yaml` whose decoded form has a `"graph"` map
  with `"nodes"` and `"edges"` lists (QA / simulation shape) or a `"definitions"` list
  of such entries (solution-pack shape) is a definition. Two guards keep the discovery
  honest: every fixture path a `scripts/seed_*_definition.sh` references must have been
  discovered, and the discovered count must not collapse below the 12 known today.

  Each graph goes through `Graph.validate_graph/1`, `validate_node_attributes/1`,
  `validate_edge_conditions/1`, `validate_flow/1` and `SemanticValidation.validate/2`
  (with no declared fields, as at an unregistered-schema install), and must report zero
  violations.

  `async: true`, read-only file I/O, no clock, no randomness.
