defmodule Letflow.Engine.InstanceStateTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Struct-shape sanity tests for `Letflow.Engine.InstanceState` (REQ-044,
  design doc §2). `Letflow.Engine.Transition`'s own tests
  (`test/letflow/engine/transition_test.exs`) exercise every REQ-044
  acceptance criterion end to end using real `InstanceState` values; this
  file only locks in the struct's documented default values and its one
  enforced key, so a future accidental default change (e.g. `status: :active`
  silently becoming `nil`, or `tokens: []` becoming `nil`) fails here
  directly instead of showing up as a confusing, indirect failure deep inside
  a `Transition` test. See `test/specs/REQ-044.md`.
