  REQ-170 -- coverage for `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.CallTimeout`. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req170-wasm-wallclock-timeout.md` (gate-approved) for
  the full rationale, live-verification findings, and AC traceability
  these tests exercise.

  SAFETY NOTE (design doc §1.5/§5.7): this file deliberately does NOT
  reproduce the design's 32-concurrent-hang worker-pool-saturation
  scenario -- that scenario durably occupies `wasmex`'s shared,
  node-global native thread pool for the remainder of any test run it is
  part of, corrupting every other WASM test's own timing assumptions.
  That finding is recorded as a one-time, this-design-session live result
  only (design §1.5, §8), not an automated regression test here.

  `async: false`: every test here builds a real Wasmtime instance via
  `wasmex`'s NIF, mirroring `plugin_handler_test.exs`'s and
  `resource_limits_test.exs`'s identical rationale for keeping WASM-NIF
  tests serial.

    # normally completes in well under 2s. Recurring CI failures (PRs #780,
