defmodule Letflow.Engine.Wasm.InvocationLeaseTest do
  @moduledoc """
  ISS-0418 -- coverage for `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.InvocationLease`'s own mechanics, in
  isolation from any real `wasmex` call. See
  `lib/letflow/design/iss0418-wasm-concurrency-cap.md` §6.5 for the full rationale.

  This suite proves the primitive's mechanics correct against a synthetic
  `Process.exit(pid, :kill)` stand-in for `PluginInterface.invoke/2,3`'s own
  brutal-kill -- fast, deterministic, zero dependency on `wasmex`. It does NOT prove
  the lease's PLACEMENT is correct against a real hang -- that is proven separately by
  the `:wasm_hang`-tagged tests wired directly in `call_timeout_test.exs`,
  `host_api_write_test.exs`, and `plugin_handler_test.exs` (design doc §6.4).

  `async: false`: several tests here start a SECOND process to exercise
  `try_acquire/1` from a distinct caller pid, and rely on this test's own isolated
  `InvocationLease` instance (started fresh per test via `start_supervised!/1`,
  mirroring `Letflow.Admission`'s own `start_link/1` test-isolation `opts` override
  convention) not being contended by any other concurrently-running test.
