  # AC4 (handoff step-03): instantiate/2's timeout branch
  # (`Task.shutdown(task, :brutal_kill)` on a `Task.yield/2` timeout) had no
  # existing coverage at all. instantiate/2 is a private function -- it
  # cannot be called directly from a test -- so the only way to exercise
  # this branch through the public API is a `register/1` call whose
  # instantiation attempt genuinely exceeds @instantiation_timeout_ms
  # (5_000ms, a private module attribute, not injectable from a test).
  #
  # That WAS reliably achieved live during this pass (not merely attempted):
  # a WAT fixture whose module has a `(start $spin)` function containing an
  # unconditional infinite loop was compiled and passed through the real
  # `register/1`. It genuinely blocked in `Wasmex.start_link/1` (confirmed
  # separately not to return even after 3s via a raw `Task.yield/2` probe)
  # and `register/1` correctly returned
  # `{:error, {:instantiation_failed, {:timeout, 5000}}}` after ~5043ms /
  # ~5061ms across two live runs -- so the timeout branch itself, and its
  # return value, ARE real and reachable, and were directly observed, not
  # inferred.
  #
  # It is NOT used as a committed automated test, for a reason discovered
  # during this same verification, not a hypothetical one: killing the Task
  # (`Task.shutdown(task, :brutal_kill)`, the correct code's own call) removes
  # the Elixir-side bookkeeping -- `Task.Supervisor.children/1` on
  # `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.ModuleRegistryTaskSupervisor` does drop back to `[]`
  # -- but the underlying native Wasmtime execution thread the NIF call
  # started keeps spinning. Measured directly: reading
  # `/proc/<beam_pid>/stat` fields 14/15 (utime/stime) immediately after
  # `register/1` returned and again after a 3-second `Process.sleep/1` with
  # nothing else running showed ~305 additional clock ticks of CPU consumed
  # during that "idle" window -- i.e. a real OS thread was still busy-looping
  # at full tilt, invisibly, after the Erlang-level cleanup this test would
  # otherwise be asserting "worked". Committing that fixture as a live
  # `mix test` case would leave a permanently CPU-spinning orphaned thread
  # for the remainder of that `mix test` BEAM process's life on every run
  # that reaches it -- a resource leak the test itself would cause, not
  # verify the absence of. This is reported to ORCH as a candidate issue
  # (REQ-166's `Task.shutdown(:brutal_kill)` does not, and by the nature of
  # a non-preemptible dirty-NIF busy loop without engine epoch interruption
  # arguably cannot, reclaim the native thread on this exact pathological
  # input) rather than fixed here -- fixing it would mean editing
  # module_registry.ex, out of TEST-DESIGNER's scope for this handoff.
  #
  # Per the handoff's own instruction to use a proxy and document the
  # limitation explicitly rather than silently skip it: the test below
  # exercises the identical `Task.Supervisor.async_nolink/2` +
  # `Task.yield/2` timeout + `Task.shutdown(task, :brutal_kill)` pattern
  # against the SAME named, running `ModuleRegistryTaskSupervisor`, with an
  # ordinary hanging BEAM process (`Process.sleep(:infinity)`, safely
  # killable, no native thread involved) standing in for the hung
  # `Wasmex.start_link/1`. It proves the shutdown call's mechanism is real
  # and does terminate an orphaned task/process of the general shape
  # instantiate/2 produces. What it does NOT prove -- stated plainly because
  # it is a real gap, not a formality -- is that `instantiate/2`'s own
  # `nil ->` branch specifically still contains that call: a mutant that
  # deleted `Task.shutdown(task, :brutal_kill)` from that exact branch
  # would NOT be caught by this proxy test, because the proxy never calls
  # through `instantiate/2` at all (it is private and unreachable from
  # outside the module). Confirmed by actually applying that mutation and
  # re-running this file: `mix test` still reported this proxy test (and
  # all 19 others) passing -- 20/20 green with the mutant in place. The
  # only mutation-sensitive evidence available for that exact line, with the
  # constraints above, is the live end-to-end verification recorded above,
  # not an automated regression test.
