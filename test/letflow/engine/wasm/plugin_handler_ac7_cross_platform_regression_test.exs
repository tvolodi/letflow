  ISS-0377 regression test -- see `test/specs/ISS-0377-regression-proof.md` for
  the full fail-then-pass evidence (including the real, non-simulated
  pre-fix-vs-post-fix run against `test/letflow/engine/wasm/plugin_handler_test.exs`
  on this Linux sandbox).

  This file exists because ISS-0377's fix to AC7's second assertion (the
  "compiled shared library is bundled" test) only manifests its bug on a
  non-Unix OS (hardcoded `.so`, wrong on Windows's `.dll`) -- something this
  Linux sandbox cannot literally reproduce by running the real
  `:code.priv_dir(:wasmex)` tree, because a real Linux wasmex build always
  happens to have a `wasmex.so` on disk regardless of whether the fix is
  applied. So this test simulates the Windows-shaped directory layout (a
  version/arch-suffixed `.dll` present, no fixed-name file) and exercises
  the exact directory-walking logic shipped in
  `test/letflow/engine/wasm/plugin_handler_test.exs`'s `native_artifact_check/2`
  (commit 8eef01b) -- copied verbatim below, since that function is a private
  `defp` inside a test module and not otherwise reachable from here.

  If this shipped logic is ever regressed back toward the pre-fix hardcoded
  `"native/wasmex.so"` path check, this test's `old_logic_result` assertion
  is the one that would have caught it (see the `describe "regression: OLD
  hardcoded .so path check"` block below, which mirrors it explicitly for
  contrast) -- and the `new_logic_result` assertion would fail on the same
  data if the fixed-name/fallback-listing logic itself is broken by a future
  edit.
