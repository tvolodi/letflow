    # unlike the ExUnit-level timeout, that assertion is an explicit numeric
    # check, so a raised @tag timeout alone does not help it. It failed
    # outright at 30_003ms on the ISS-0352/PR #786 recurrence -- a value the
    # old 15_000ms bound could never tolerate no matter how much CI-runner
    # contention was in play. The loosened bound still discriminates real
    # regressions: `long_elapsed_ms > 6_000` (below, unchanged) still rules
    # out timeout_ms being silently dropped to wasmex's hardcoded 5_000ms
    # default, and 45_000ms remains well short of any point where this
    # assertion would stop meaning anything.
