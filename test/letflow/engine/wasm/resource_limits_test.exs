defmodule Letflow.Engine.Wasm.ResourceLimitsTest do

  REQ-169 -- coverage for `Letflow.Engine.Wasm.ResourceLimits`. See
  `lib/letflow/design/req169-wasm-fuel-and-memory-cap.md` (gate-approved)
  for the full rationale, live-verification findings, and AC traceability
  these tests exercise.

  No REQ-171/172 host function exists yet, so tests exercise `ResourceLimits`
  directly against dedicated fixtures (`priv/wasm_fixtures/req169_*.wat`),
  mirroring `memory_guard_test.exs`'s identical precedent (REQ-168).

  **AC3's memory-cap test is written against the real, live-verified
  behavior, NOT against WASM-10's literal "traps cleanly" wording.**
  `memory.grow` beyond `StoreLimits.memory_size` returns an ordinary
  success (`{:ok, [-1]}`), never a trap -- see design §1.6/§2/§7 for the
  full divergence statement. This is a deliberate, documented departure
  from the acceptance criterion's literal wording, not an oversight.

  `async: false`: every test here builds a real Wasmtime instance via
  `wasmex`'s NIF and dispatches guest calls through the shared
  `Letflow.Engine.PluginTaskSupervisor`, mirroring `plugin_handler_test.exs`'s
  and `memory_guard_test.exs`'s identical rationale for keeping WASM-NIF
  tests serial.
