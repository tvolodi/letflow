defmodule Letflow.IdentityMigrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for `Letflow.IdentityMigration.copy_all_tenants/0`/`copy_tenant/2` (REQ-063
  §4) and `priv/repo/migrations/20260819000004_drop_legacy_public_identity_tables.exs`'s
  guard-skip/guard-proceed behavior (REQ-063 §5). See `test/specs/REQ-063.md` for the
  full test-case rationale.

  Uses `Letflow.DataCase` (real Postgres) per `docs/guides/test_developer_guide.md`
  DIRECTIVE T-1 — no mocked database anywhere in this file.

  ## Why this file recreates `public.users`/`public.groups`/`public.tenant_role`

  This branch's own `mix ecto.migrate` run already applied
  `20260819000004_drop_legacy_public_identity_tables.exs` against this test
  database — the legacy `public.users`/`public.groups`/`public.tenant_role` tables
  are already gone (confirmed via `to_regclass('public.users')` returning `NULL`
  before this file was drafted), which is the correct, permanent end state for a
  real environment. To exercise `copy_all_tenants/0` (which reads FROM those legacy
  tables) and the drop migration's guard (which checks them) at all, this file
  recreates minimal, throwaway versions of the three tables directly via
  `Repo.query!/2` DDL, seeds them with realistic pre-cutover rows, runs the code
  under test against that throwaway state, and drops the throwaway tables again in
  `on_exit/1`. This does not touch any shipped migration file or change what a real
  `mix ecto.migrate` run does — it reconstructs the exact pre-cutover physical shape
  those three legacy migrations originally created (confirmed against
  `priv/repo/migrations/20260816000002_create_groups.exs`,
  `20260816000003_create_tenant_role.exs`, `20260816000004_create_users.exs`'s own
  column lists), scoped to only the columns this file's tests actually touch.

  `Ecto.Migrator.run/4`'s explicit `[{version, module}]` form needs the drop
  migration's module genuinely loaded into this run's BEAM VM first —
  `priv/repo/migrations/*.exs` is outside `:test`'s `elixirc_paths`, and (per
  `test/letflow/event_store/registry_test.exs`'s own documented finding, ISS-0017/
  ELIXIR-DEV's Step 2a handoff) once a migration's version is already recorded in
  `schema_migrations` (true here, since this branch's own `mix ecto.migrate` already
  ran it once), `Ecto.Migrator`'s directory scan never re-loads the module on a
  later `mix ecto.migrate`, so calling `Ecto.Migrator.run/4` directly with an
  explicit `{version, module}` tuple raises `Ecto.MigrationError` unless the module
  is `Code.require_file/1`'d first — `ensure_drop_migration_loaded!/0` below mirrors
  `registry_test.exs`'s exact, already-established workaround for this same
  documented gap.

  Follows the same `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.mode(Letflow.Repo, :auto)` + manual
  `on_exit/1` cleanup pattern `test/letflow/tenant_provisioning_test.exs` and
  `test/letflow/identity_test.exs` already establish (`Ecto.Migrator` cannot run
  under the sandbox's single shared connection). `async: false` for the whole module
  (ExUnit's `async` setting is module-wide).

  # already has (ISS-0229 section 2.2 rules out CASCADE -- which would silently
  # vaporise the parked row -- and SET NULL/RESTRICT). Column list, order and
  # types are UNCHANGED, so this stays the exact structural mirror of

  # while public.tenant_schemas.tenant_id did, so a concurrent teardown could
  # destroy the parked row's parent tenant; the move-back then raised 23503 and
  # -- because it runs from this file's own setup -- failed every test in this
  # file, permanently, on every later run.
  #
  # The failing state cannot be built by simply INSERTing an orphan row once the
  # constraint exists (the seeding INSERT would itself raise 23503). These tests
  # therefore reproduce the real pre-convergence shape -- constraint dropped,
  # orphan parked -- exactly as ISS-0229 section 5.1 prescribes.
  #
  # Nothing here names ensure_backup_table_fk!/0 or
  # restore_or_discard_backup_rows!/0 (section 5.1.1's naming rule): the block
  # names only helpers that already existed before the fix, so it still compiles
  # against reverted helper bodies and the fail-first demonstration is a
  # behavioural 23503 rather than a compile error. Everything the new helpers
  # own is observed without naming them -- constraint presence, confdeltype and
  # enforcement are read straight out of pg_constraint / proven by a rejected
  # INSERT.
  #
  # Cleanup follows section 5.1.1's mandated three-callback shape. on_exit/1 is
  # LIFO (ExUnit.OnExitHandler.add/3 appends, run/2 reverses), so callbacks are
  # registered in the reverse of the order they must run: (A) first, carrying
  # step 4; (B) after the real Tenant insert, carrying steps 2-3; (C) after the
  # backup-row ids exist and before any DDL/DML, carrying step 1. Execution is
  # (C) -> (B) -> (A) = backup rows removed, then the tenant, then
  # heal-then-constrain last over an already-empty table -- which is the
  # precondition the validating ALTER needs. Each is a BARE on_exit/1 with no
  # name argument: ExUnit.OnExitHandler.add/3 keys on name_or_ref, so reusing a
