defmodule Letflow.LoginDiscovery.Notifier.SmtpSinkAwaitClosedTest do
  @moduledoc """
  ISS-0996 (Q-978 / GH #2259). `Smtp.deliver_tenant_list/2` returns as soon as the client
  has *sent* QUIT, possibly before the sink handler has recorded it. Readers of the
  sink's transcript must call `SmtpSink.await_closed/2` first. This suite pins that:

    * the formerly racy delivery-then-assert-order sequence, run back-to-back `@loops`
      times, never observes a transcript missing its tail;
    * `await_closed/2` is deterministic (no sleep) and fails loudly on a connection that
      never closes.

  `async: false`: application env, OS env and the sink (same as the suites it guards).
