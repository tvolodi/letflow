defmodule Letflow.LoginDiscovery.Notifier.SmtpSinkRegistrationTest do
  @moduledoc """
  ISS-1019 (Q-1001 / GH #2288). `SmtpSink` used to insert a connection record with
  `handler: nil` and store the handler pid in a second step, so a reader (for example
  `open_connections/1` followed by `await_closed/2`) could see an open record that
  `await_closed/2` could not monitor. The record and the handler pid are now registered in
  one Agent call.

  The invariant pinned here: every record visible with `open?: true` has a pid handler.
  A watcher process spins on `SmtpSink.transcripts/1` (no sleeps) while the test opens
  `@connections` connections against a `:hang` sink, with busy processes widening the
  scheduling window. Fail-first: on the old sink the watcher observes records with
  `handler: nil`.

  `async: false`: it saturates the schedulers on purpose.
