defmodule Letflow.Plugs.AuthorizeTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Direct, DB-free unit tests for `Letflow.Plugs.Authorize` (REQ-131).

  Written by TEST-DESIGNER during REQ-131's WF-02 Step 3 coverage-verification
  pass, closing gaps left by ELIXIR-DEV's `test/letflow/api/authorization_enforcement_test.exs`
  (which only proves every route's *declared* policy key resolves to a real,
  present `Letflow.Api.Authorization.endpoint_policy_key/2` clause — a
  structural check, not a runtime one) and by the router/integration tests
  updated for REQ-131 (`test/letflow/router_test.exs`,
  `test/letflow/plugs/api_pipeline_integration_test.exs`), which only ever
  exercise a caller whose role is dropped entirely (unrecognized "VIEWER"),
  never a real `PLATFORM_ADMIN`.

  `authorization_enforcement_test.exs`'s own moduledoc explicitly defers the
  "route with NO policy key" runtime case to a file named
  `test/letflow/api/authorize_plug_test.exs` for AC5's unmatched-route case —
  that file does not exist anywhere in this codebase (confirmed by a
  filesystem search before writing this one). This file is that missing
  runtime coverage, named to match this module's own location instead
  (`test/letflow/plugs/`, matching every other `Letflow.Plugs.*` test in this
  directory) since router-independent unit coverage of the plug itself is
  the more direct proof.

  Dispatches straight to `Letflow.Plugs.Authorize.call/2` — no router, no
  `Plug.Test` HTTP verb dispatch, no DB — since the plug's own behaviour
  depends only on `conn.private[:policy_key]` and `conn.assigns[:auth_context]`,
  and `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.schema_name_for_tenant/1` (called internally
  via `Letflow.Api.Context.scoped_repo_opts/1`) is pure UUID-string
  manipulation with no I/O (confirmed by reading `lib/letflow/tenant_provisioning.ex`
  directly) — a syntactically valid UUID is sufficient, no real tenant needs
  to exist.

  Covers REQ-131's acceptance criteria:

    * AC1 — a 403 is an RFC 9457 problem document via `Letflow.Api.Response`,
      asserted on both body shape and `Content-Type`.
    * AC4 — the enforcement artefact that fails, at runtime, when a route
      carries no policy key: `no_policy_key_denies_non_admin_test/1` below
      exercises this every run (not just a one-time manual demo during
      implementation).
    * AC5 — an unmatched `(method, path)`, i.e. no `:policy_key` private key
      present, denies every role except `PLATFORM_ADMIN` — both halves: the
      non-admin denial (already indirectly covered elsewhere) AND the
      `PLATFORM_ADMIN` allow, which no other test in this codebase exercises.
    * AC6 — an unrecognized role string is treated as holding no role, not as
      an unknown-but-accepted one, exercised directly against the plug (not
      just `Letflow.Api.Authorization.roles_from_strings/1` in isolation,
      which `test/letflow/api/authorization_test.exs` already covers).

  # plain get/post/patch/delete macros, or a router's own `match _`
  # catch-all) must still deny a non-admin caller -- proving the plug is
  # unconditional rather than opt-in. Unlike authorization_enforcement_test.exs
  # (which asserts every route's DECLARED key resolves to a real matrix
  # clause, a static/structural property), this exercises the actual
  # fail-closed behaviour a route WITHOUT any key gets at request time.
