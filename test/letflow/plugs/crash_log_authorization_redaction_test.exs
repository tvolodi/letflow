defmodule Letflow.Plugs.CrashLogAuthorizationRedactionTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression test for ISS-0769 -- a raw `Authorization` bearer-token value leaking
  into crash/error log output via Bandit's own `Bandit.Pipeline.run/5` `catch`
  clause, which passes the fully-built `conn` (including `conn.req_headers`) into
  `Logger.error/2` metadata on any unrescued exception.

  This exercises the REAL path: a real `Bandit` listener (started by this test --
  `config/test.exs`'s `start_http: false` only gates the application's own
  supervised listener), a real HTTP request via `:httpc`, and a deliberately
  raising plug -- not just `Letflow.Secrets.Redaction.redact_map/1` in isolation.
  See `lib/letflow/design/iss0769-crash-log-header-redaction.md` §4.3.

  `async: false`: starts a real listener on an OS-assigned port and touches
  process-global `:logger` state, same rationale as
  `test/letflow/secrets/log_filter_test.exs`.
