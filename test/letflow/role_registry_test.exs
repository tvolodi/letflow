defmodule Letflow.Identity.RoleRegistryTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for `Letflow.Identity.RoleRegistry` (REQ-020): `list_roles/1`,
  `upsert_role/3`, `resolve_role_in_tx/1`. See `test/specs/REQ-020.md` for the full
  test-case rationale, including why AC5 (the `@moduledoc` content requirement) has no
  runtime test here and why AC4's "never raises" clause is covered the way it is.

  Separate file from `test/letflow/identity_test.exs` deliberately, mirroring
  `lib/letflow/design/req020-role-registry.md` §1's own module-boundary decision:
  `Letflow.Identity.RoleRegistry` is a standalone module, not a function added to
  `Letflow.Identity`, specifically so the "no OIDC-pipeline coupling" invariant is
  structural rather than a convention inside a file that already imports OIDC-adjacent
  aliases for sibling functions. The test file mirrors that same boundary — this file
  never aliases `Letflow.Identity` or any `Letflow.Oidc.*` module, matching the
  production module it tests.

  Uses `Letflow.DataCase` (real Postgres) per `docs/guides/test_developer_guide.md`
  DIRECTIVE T-1 — no mocked database anywhere in this file.

  ## REQ-063 fixture change (read before touching a test here)

  REQ-063 (`lib/letflow/design/req063-identity-tables-schema-per-tenant.md`) moved
  `groups`/`tenant_role` out of `public` into each tenant's own provisioned Postgres
  schema. `Letflow.Identity.RoleRegistry` itself was deliberately NOT modified by
  REQ-063 (out of that design's scope — see
  `lib/letflow/design/req020-role-registry.md`'s "Why zero arguments" section,
  which explicitly documents that `list_roles/0`/`upsert_role/2`/
  `resolve_role_in_tx/1` all take no tenant/prefix parameter today, relying on a
  future per-request `SET search_path` mechanism Letflow has "not built yet" as of
  REQ-020's own writing). REQ-063 made that future mechanism's absence concrete: with
  `groups`/`tenant_role` no longer in `public` at all, `RoleRegistry`'s unprefixed
  queries now need a real `search_path` pointed at a tenant schema to find anything.

  This file therefore now provisions a real tenant schema per test (`Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.mode(Letflow.Repo, :auto)`
  + `TenantProvisioning.provision_tenant_schema/1` + `replay_migrations/2`) and
  issues `SET search_path TO "<schema>", public` on that connection before each
  test body runs — see `test/letflow/identity/user_test.exs`'s own moduledoc,
  "Sandbox mode: what ACTUALLY protects against cross-test leakage" section, for
  the full reasoning. In short: switching to `:auto` mode above checks in
  (discards) whatever sandboxed transaction `Letflow.DataCase`'s own setup had
  already checked out, so `SET search_path` is NOT automatically reverted by any
  rollback at that point — an earlier version of this moduledoc wrongly claimed
  it was. What actually protects against leakage is that this file's `setup`
  below explicitly restores a real sandboxed transaction
  (`Sandbox.mode(Repo, :manual)` + fresh `Sandbox.checkout/1`) immediately after
  the migration-replay work finishes and BEFORE issuing `SET search_path`, so
  the `SET search_path` call and everything the test body does afterward run
  inside a transaction that gets rolled back at teardown. Deliberately NOT
  `{:shared, self()}` mode: this file's tests are single-process (no
  `Task.async` spawns needing to share the connection).

  This deliberately does NOT register an `on_exit/1`-based `Sandbox.checkin/1`
  either. An earlier version of this fix did, believing the checkin closed the
  loop; it did not — `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox.checkin/1` (and
  `DBConnection.Ownership`'s `ownership_checkin`/`proxy_checkin` underneath it,
  see `deps/db_connection/lib/db_connection/ownership/manager.ex`) keys the
  checkin by the CALLING process's own pid, but `ExUnit.OnExitHandler` runs
  every `on_exit/1` callback via `spawn_monitor` in a dedicated runner process,
  never the original test process that performed the checkout — so a checkin
  issued from `on_exit/1` checks in on behalf of the wrong process and silently
  no-ops (`:not_found`). What actually reclaims the checked-out connection and
  rolls back its transaction is `DBConnection.Ownership.Manager`'s own
  unconditional `:DOWN`-monitor handler (`handle_info({:DOWN, ref, _, _, _},
  state)`), which fires automatically once this test's own process exits — the
  exact mechanism `Letflow.DataCase`'s own `{:shared, self()}` checkout already
  relies on (it never calls `checkin/1` either). No explicit checkin step is
  attempted here.
  `Ecto.Migrator` cannot run under the sandbox's single shared connection
  (`lib/letflow/design/req022-tenant-schema-provisioning.md` §6's testing-
  environment caveat), so this file is now `async: false` for its entire module
  (ExUnit's `async` setting is module-wide) — unlike its pre-REQ-063 version, which
  ran `async: true` against bare `public` tables. Every test still builds its own
  unique `Group`/`TenantRole` fixture names (no shared hardcoded values), and since
  each test also gets its OWN freshly-provisioned tenant schema (not merely a
  rolled-back transaction against a shared one), `tenant_role.name`'s table-wide
  unique index cannot collide across tests even though they now run sequentially
  rather than concurrently.
