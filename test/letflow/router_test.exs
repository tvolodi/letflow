defmodule Letflow.RouterTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for `Letflow.Router` (REQ-046, `test/specs/REQ-046.md`).

  Router-level end-to-end tests via `Plug.Test`, per
  `docs/guides/test_developer_guide.md` §2 ("test/letflow/*_test.exs exercising
  Letflow.Router end to end ... coverage target: every documented HTTP endpoint") and
  the `Plug.Test` convention already established in
  `test/letflow/plugs/tenant_status_test.exs`. No database dependency: every route this
  module currently exposes (`GET /health`, the 404 catch-all) is DB-free by design (the
  health check's own inline comment states this explicitly), so plain `ExUnit.Case` is
  used rather than `Letflow.DataCase`.

  REQ-046 removed three routes (`POST /instances`, `POST /instances/:id/actions`,
  `GET /instances/:id`) that used to call `Letflow.InstanceSupervisor.start_instance/1`
  and `Letflow.ProcessInstance.*` — both now deleted. Cases 2-4 below are regression
  coverage for that deletion: run against the pre-REQ-046 router they would not have
  seen a clean 404 at all, they would have hit a runtime `UndefinedFunctionError`
  (wrapped as a 500 by Plug's error handling), since the routes existed but called
  functions that no longer compiled. Passing here proves the routes were cleanly
  removed, not left dangling.

  # REQ-070 AC5 originally pinned 11 deferred module names. The number is 9 as of
  # REQ-310 (commit f6e0ae64), and the drop is not arbitrary: REQ-310 built the entity
  # HTTP surface and deleted BOTH the `Letflow.Routers.Entities` and the
  # `Letflow.Routers.EntityQuery` rows from router.ex's deferred table, per
  # lib/letflow/design/req308-entity-http-surface.md §8, which specifies clean removal
  # rather than annotation ("a table documenting 'not yet mounted' routes has nothing
  # left to say once the corresponding module exists and is forwarded"). Two rows went,
  # but only ONE module was built: design §2 ruled the two names an R-Co-filename
  # artefact rather than two URL prefixes, and merged both into the single
  # `Letflow.Routers.Entities`, mounted by `forward("/entities", ...)` in
  # lib/letflow/plugs/api_pipeline.ex. `Letflow.Routers.EntityQuery` was therefore
  # retired without ever existing — its query surface lands as POST /entities/query on
  # the merged module (REQ-311), not as a module of its own.
