defmodule Letflow.SandboxPoolTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for `Letflow.SandboxPool` (REQ-039): `claim/1,2` and `release/1,2`. See
  `test/specs/REQ-039.md` for the full test-case rationale.

  Uses `Letflow.DataCase` (real Postgres) per `docs/guides/test_developer_guide.md`
  DIRECTIVE T-1 -- no mocked database anywhere in this file.

  ## Why this whole file runs under Sandbox `:auto` mode (not DataCase's normal
  ## rolled-back transaction)

  `SandboxPool.claim/1,2` calls `Ecto.Migrator.run/4` internally (to scaffold every
  `Letflow.TenantProvisioning.tenant_scoped_migrations/0` table into the freshly
  `CREATE SCHEMA`'d sandbox). `test/letflow/tenant_provisioning_test.exs` already hit
  and solved this exact problem for `replay_migrations/2` -- read that file's
  moduledoc and its `describe "replay_migrations/2 -- successful replay (acceptance
  criterion 3)"` block for the full empirical investigation (`Ecto.Migrator` genuinely
  needs a second, independent DB connection beyond whatever DataCase's sandboxed
  checkout hands this process, which raises `DBConnection.ConnectionError` /
  `:queue_timeout` under the default shared-connection sandbox mode). This file's
  `setup` block applies that same fix -- switch `Letflow.Repo` to Sandbox `:auto` mode
  -- for every test up front (not just a subset of describe blocks), because
  practically every test in this file calls `claim/1,2` at least once. As a
  consequence, **no test in this file is rolled back automatically**: every real
  Postgres schema this file creates is dropped explicitly, via `release/1,2` and/or a
  defensive `on_exit/1` `DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS ... CASCADE` fallback right after each
  claim succeeds (belt-and-suspenders: the fallback is a no-op on the normal path,
  where `release/1,2` already dropped the schema).

  `async: false` for the whole module, for the identical reason
  `tenant_provisioning_test.exs` is `async: false` -- see that file's moduledoc for
  the full argument (traced directly from ExUnit's own `async_loop/4` source) that
  switching `Letflow.Repo`'s sandbox mode mid-test cannot corrupt any other
  concurrently running test file's connection, because ExUnit never runs an
  `async: false` module concurrently with anything else.

  ## Why this file starts its own uniquely-named `SandboxPool` instance per test,
  ## rather than using the application's singleton `Letflow.SandboxPool`

  Per the design doc (`lib/letflow/design/req039-sandbox-pool-fixture-loader.md` §4.2,
  §4.7 INV-SP-7), `start_link/1`'s `:name` option exists specifically so a test can
  start an independent pool with its own small `:max_concurrent`, deterministically
  exercising the quota-exhausted/blocking-wait behaviour (acceptance criterion 2)
  without contending for, or being polluted by, the application's own singleton pool
  (`config/test.exs` sets that singleton's quota to `max_concurrent_sandboxes: 1`
  specifically so *that* value stays cheap for whatever future test wants it, e.g. a
  REQ-040 test exercising the real end-to-end orchestration against the default pool --
  not so every SandboxPool test in this project has to share one global slot). See
  `start_pool!/1` below.

  # was originally derived from. Lowered to 100 ms to clear that one real CI
  # observation with headroom (151/100 ≈ 1.51x), following the same "vacuity floor,
  # not a tolerance" shape -- below it the defect genuinely cannot exist. This is a
  # single real sample, not a full measurement window per the original derivation's

  # The original CI-observed trigger (a real Postgres query_canceled under a
  # throttled runner) is not reproducible on demand, so every case below exercises
  # the fix's actual new logic through a DETERMINISTIC trigger instead -- a stateful
  # counter for retry_query_once/1, and a real-but-genuinely-broken DROP SQL text for
  # resilient_drop_schema/1 -- rather than depending on CI timing. None of these
  # cases are vacuous: each fails against the pre-fix code (see the RT-8 case's own
  # note, and this run's git-worktree comparison recorded in the WF-03 handoff) or,
  # for the two retry_query_once/1 cases, would fail immediately against ANY version
  # of this file that lacks retry_query_once/1 altogether.
