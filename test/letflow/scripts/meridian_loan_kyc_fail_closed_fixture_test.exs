defmodule Letflow.Scripts.MeridianLoanKycFailClosedFixtureTest do
  @moduledoc """
  ISS-1020 / Q-1002 (GH #2289) -- the QA Meridian "Loan Origination" fixture (v1.7, now v1.8) must
  fail CLOSED on the KYC/AML control: a KYC hit / inconclusive / unknown screening whose
  manual review times out, is rejected, or never records an outcome must NOT reach
  `authority-routing` (the approval path), `create-facility` or `disburse-loan`.

  v1.6 defect: `kyc-manual-review` -> `assessment-join` (and `timeout-kyc-manual-review` ->
  `kyc-timeout` -> `assessment-join`) carried no outcome, and `eligibility-gate` e15 read only
  `credit_decision` and `risk_rating`, never any KYC value.

  v1.7: the outcome is an explicit variable. `kyc-manual-review` is completed with output
  variable `kyc_outcome` = `cleared` | `rejected`; the `kyc-timeout` service task records
  `kyc_outcome` = `unresolved` (the QA stub echoes it, like `kyc-aml-check` echoes
  `kyc_status`). `eligibility-gate` has two approval edges -- `e15` (screening answered
  `kyc_status == 'clear'`) and `e15-kyc-cleared` (`kyc_outcome == 'cleared'`) -- and
  everything else falls to the default edge -> `decline-application`.

  ## Why two edges, not `kyc_status == 'clear' || kyc_outcome == 'cleared'`

  Probed against the real evaluator: a reference to a variable that is not set makes the
  comparison an eval error and `Letflow.Engine.Expr.evaluate_condition/2` returns `false`
  for the WHOLE condition -- there is no short-circuit across `||`. A single OR condition
  would therefore decline the UAT fast path (`kyc_status` 'clear', no `kyc_outcome`).

  ## risk_rating (acceptance criterion: engine-level proof)

  An UNSET `risk_rating` already fails closed (the same missing-key eval error makes
  `risk_rating != 'unacceptable'` false), but an explicit `null` or `''` PASSED the v1.6
  gate (`null != 'unacceptable'` is true). v1.7 requires the rating to be present and not
  empty as well as not `unacceptable`. These tests drive the REAL `Letflow.Engine.Transition`
  gateway dispatch (token at `eligibility-gate`, `{:advance_token, _}`), not a re-implementation.

  Pure: no DB, no HTTP.
