defmodule Letflow.Scripts.MeridianLoanOriginationFixtureTest do
  @moduledoc """
  ISS-0928 / Q-928 T8 -- the QA Meridian "Loan Origination" fixture must give the
  `kyc-routing` EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY an unconditioned default edge, so a KYC stub
  response with no `kyc_status` key does not stall (ISS-0998: it now goes to `kyc-manual-review`, not `assessment-join`) instead of
  erroring (or, pre-fix, stalling) the instance. The version was bumped to 1.2 (ISS-0928; now 1.8: ISS-0998 changed the kyc default edge target to kyc-manual-review; ISS-1001 the l2-approval fallback to decline-application; ISS-1020 the KYC outcome gate; ISS-1024 the three distinct committee-vote roles, see meridian_loan_kyc_fail_closed_fixture_test.exs) so
  `scripts/seed_meridian_definition.sh` re-seeds QA (409 means bump, never delete).

  Pure: no DB, no HTTP. See `test/specs/ISS-0928.md`.
