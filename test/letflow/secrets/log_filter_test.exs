defmodule Letflow.Secrets.LogFilterTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Tests for REQ-190 AC7's second half -- proving `Letflow.Secrets.LogFilter` (the real
  `:logger` primary filter `Letflow.Application.start/2` registers) actually intercepts
  a real `Logger` call and redacts sensitive-keyed metadata before it reaches captured
  output, not just that the underlying pure function
  (`Letflow.Secrets.Redaction.redact_map/1`, covered by `redaction_test.exs`) is
  correct in isolation. See `test/specs/REQ-190.md`.

  `async: false`: `:logger.add_primary_filter/2` is a node-global registration this
  test relies on already being in place (via `Letflow.Application.start/2`, which ran
  once at suite boot) -- no per-test mutation of the filter itself, but log capture
  ordering is safer serialized alongside every other test file that touches `Logger`
  configuration in this codebase.

  # include the inspected event (metadata map) in the captured string. This is a
  # test-visibility mechanism only; it does not change
  # which filter runs or what it redacts -- `Letflow.Secrets.LogFilter.filter/2`
  # (registered once, node-wide, by `Letflow.Application.start/2`) has already run
  # on `log_event.meta` before the formatter ever sees it.
