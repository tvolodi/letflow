defmodule Letflow.Simulation.Req207VortexTest do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-207 acceptance criteria: 4 Vortex scenario YAMLs run through
  `Letflow.Simulation.Runner`, each returning a closed disposition:
  EXECUTED/PASS-or-FAIL (production-order-above-threshold, supplier-quality-deviation
  critical/false-positive), BLOCKED_ON_DEPENDENCY (entity-list-filter-and-page).

  ## entity-list-filter-and-page disposition, re-derived 2026-09-11 (REQ-311)

  Still BLOCKED_ON_DEPENDENCY -- but the blocker has now moved OUT of `lib/`
  entirely, and its owner has changed from S10 to S8.

  The dependency has been re-derived twice on 2026-09-11, each time because a
  deliberately-armed tripwire fired on real code rather than on a status field:

    1. REQ-310 landed `Letflow.Routers.Entities` with nine routes and mounted
       it at `/entities`, falsifying the original "the entity subsystem has no
       HTTP surface" reason. The blocker narrowed to the missing record-read
       route.
    2. REQ-311 appended the tenth route, `POST /entities/query`, completing the
       record READ path. Every HTTP surface this scenario's six `:gui` steps
       need now exists and serves.

  What remains is not a missing subsystem at all: `Letflow.Simulation.Runner`
  matches a bare `:gui ->` clause and records `:deferred_to_s8` unconditionally,
  dispatching no GUI step whatsoever, so the six steps still cannot execute.
  That is S8's frontend-cutover work. **Nothing under `lib/` blocks this
  scenario any longer.** `Letflow.Entities.Records` remaining command-only is
  now evidence of correctness (reads belong exclusively to the query route,
  where `FieldGrants` redaction is enforced) rather than evidence of a gap.

  ## Allowlist triage round, 2026-09-11 (S10 fourth batch: REQ-312/313/314)

  REQ-312 (S10 gap 2, aggregation/reporting query, pending), REQ-313 (S10 gap
  3, entity-record attachments, done) and REQ-314 (S10 gap 12, bulk
  import/export, pending) tripped the entity-title tripwire and were admitted
  to `allowed_ids` unconditionally, not `pending_only_ids` -- all three are
  design-only, scoped identically to REQ-308's own precedent (design artefact
  under `lib/letflow/design/`, no route, no context module, no migration, no
  test), so attaching a future design to the landed HTTP surface is not the
  same as building on it. REQ-313's `status: done` was independently
  re-verified against its actual landed commits (not the requirement text)
  before admission -- see the comment on the allowlist entry for the full
  verification trail. Disposition unaffected; this scenario's blocker
  remains the S8 harness (Signal 5), unchanged by this round.

  ## REQ-315 lands, 2026-09-12 (eleventh route -- re-derived, not waved through)

  REQ-315 ("Implement the aggregation/reporting query route for entity
  records (S10 gap 2)") is the IMPLEMENTATION of REQ-312's design, and unlike
  REQ-312/313/314 it is not design-only: it lands real code -- a new
  `Letflow.Api.Authorization` permission atom `:EntitiesAggregate`, a new
  `Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler.run_aggregate/2`, and an eleventh route,
  `POST /entities/query/aggregate`, mounted on `Letflow.Routers.Entities`
  (confirmed live via `__authz_routes__/0`, not trusted from the requirement
  text). That makes it look like the REQ-310/311 case (builds the HTTP
  surface) rather than the REQ-312/313/314 case (attaches nothing), so per
  the ⛔ block below it was NOT dropped straight into `allowed_ids` --  it was
  re-derived first, the same procedure REQ-310 and REQ-311 were put through.

  The re-derivation's finding: this scenario's six `:gui` steps are list,
  filter x2, sort, page and field-redaction reads over individual entity
  records, and all six read through `POST /entities/query` (REQ-311's
  route) -- none of them aggregates anything. `POST /entities/query/aggregate`
  is a DIFFERENT read shape (aggregate result rows, no `next_cursor`, gated
  by the DISTINCT `:EntitiesAggregate` permission, per the route's own
  design §2/§4) that this scenario's fixture never calls and has no reason
  to. So, unlike REQ-310 (closed the "no HTTP surface" gap) and REQ-311
  (closed the "no record-read route" gap), REQ-315 closes no gap this
  scenario was waiting on. Signal 3'' below was updated to assert the real,
  now-eleven-route set by equality (never membership, so a twelfth route or a
  dropped one lands back here too), and the disposition itself is
  UNCHANGED: still `BLOCKED_ON_DEPENDENCY`, still on S8's GUI-step harness
  (Signal 5), still nothing under `lib/` left for this scenario to wait on.
  REQ-315 was then admitted to `allowed_ids` on the strength of that
  completed re-derivation -- the same basis REQ-310/311 were, not the
  "never builds anything" basis REQ-308/312/313/314 were.

  ## REQ-317/318/319/320 triaged the same day, discovered while fixing REQ-315

  Filing REQ-315 landing also exposed that REQ-317 (attachment routes),
  REQ-318 (export/import permission atoms), REQ-319 (export route) and
  REQ-320 (import route) -- filed on `main` alongside REQ-315 in the same
  S10 gap 3/12 batch -- also trip this tripwire and had not yet been
  triaged. All four are `status: pending` (nothing landed) and none of
  their planned routes serves this scenario's six `:gui` steps (individual-
  record list/filter/sort/page/redaction, exclusively through REQ-311's
  `POST /entities/query`), so all four were admitted to `allowed_ids`
  unconditionally -- see the allowlist entries themselves for why this is
  safe even for the two (REQ-317, REQ-319/320) that plan to extend
  `Letflow.Routers.Entities`: Signal 3'' below already asserts that
  router's route set by equality, so their eventual landing is caught
  structurally regardless of this allowlist's state.

  ## REQ-317 lands, 2026-09-12 (fifteenth route -- re-derived, not waved through)

  REQ-317 ("Add the entity-attachment permission atoms and the four record-
  attachment routes to Letflow.Routers.Entities (S10 gap 3, part 2)") lands
  real code on `Letflow.Routers.Entities`: two new
  `Letflow.Api.Authorization` permission atoms
  (`:EntitiesAttachmentsManage`/`:EntitiesAttachmentsRead`) and four new
  routes -- `POST`/`GET /records/:entity_type/:record_id/attachments` and
  `GET`/`DELETE /records/:entity_type/:record_id/attachments/:attachment_id`
  -- confirmed live via `__authz_routes__/0`, not trusted from the
  requirement text. Re-derived the same way REQ-315 was: this scenario's six
  `:gui` steps are list/filter x2/sort/page/field-redaction reads over
  individual entity records' `field_values`, all exclusively through
  `POST /entities/query` (REQ-311's route) -- none of them uploads, lists,
  downloads, or deletes a binary file attached to a record. The four new
  routes are a DIFFERENT capability (record-attachment lifecycle, gated by
  the DISTINCT `:EntitiesAttachmentsManage`/`:EntitiesAttachmentsRead`
  permissions, per design req313-entity-record-attachments.md §3/§4) that
  this scenario's fixture never calls and has no reason to. So, like REQ-315
  (and unlike REQ-310/311), REQ-317 closes no gap this scenario was waiting
  on. Signal 3'' below was updated to assert the real, now-fifteen-route set
  by equality, and the disposition itself is UNCHANGED: still
  `BLOCKED_ON_DEPENDENCY`, still on S8's GUI-step harness (Signal 5), still
  nothing under `lib/` left for this scenario to wait on.

  Full reasoning and the complete re-derivation history live in that describe
  block's own comments; `test/specs/REQ-310.md` states the test cases.

  ## SERVICE_TASK limitation (affects all 3 real scenarios, design §0.3/§2)
  `Letflow.Engine` does not yet dispatch SERVICE_TASK nodes. The real
  `process_quality_check.yaml`/`process_work_order.yaml` fixtures have SERVICE_TASKs on
  their critical paths. Test-local simplified process graphs
  (`@simple_production_order_graph`, `@simple_supplier_deviation_graph`) replace them
  with direct edges/END nodes (production-order) or a HUMAN_TASK substitute
  (quarantine-batch, so EO-001's audit-event-ordering claim has real evidence) --
  mirrors REQ-206's `@simple_approval_graph` precedent exactly.

  ## OQ-2 (design §7) -- RESOLVED: no by-parent-instance-id lookup function exists on
  `Letflow.Instances`/`Letflow.Engine` (confirmed by reading both modules this session).
  `Letflow.EventStore.InstanceProjection.parent_instance_id` IS a real, populated column
  (`Letflow.Engine.SubProcess.insert_child_instance_projection/8` sets it on every
  sub-process child row) -- resolved here via a direct, test-local `Repo` query against
  that column (`find_child_by_parent_instance_id/2`, below), the narrowest read
  consistent with "no by-parent context function exists yet."

  ## OQ-3 (design §7) -- RESOLVED, differently than either candidate the design named:
  `InstanceProjection.current_nodes` is NOT usable for terminal-node identity --
  `Letflow.Engine.Transition`'s `dispatch_end/3` (transition.ex:373-379)
  unconditionally drops a token the instant it reaches an END node, so
  `current_nodes` is always `[]` once `status == :completed`, for every terminal END
  node alike (confirmed empirically this session: both scenarios below hit this).
  The real, queryable distinguishing signal is each scenario's own last real
  `TASK_COMPLETED`/`SUB_PROCESS_COMPLETED` event payload's `"activated_nodes"` field
  (via `Letflow.Instances.history/3`) -- see each describe block below for the exact
  per-scenario reasoning.

      # ⛔ DISPOSITION RE-DERIVED 2026-09-11 (SECOND TIME THE SAME DAY), AFTER
      # REQ-311 LANDED. THE TRIPWIRE FIRED A SECOND TIME, EXACTLY AS ARMED.
      #
      # What fired: Signal 3'''s nine-route equality assertion, with
      #   "Unexpected: [{\"POST\", \"/query\", :EntitiesQuery}]; missing: []."
      # -- the literal failure message the previous round wrote for this
      # moment. Once again it fired on the CODE, not on the status list:
      # docs/requirements.yaml still reads REQ-311 `status: pending` because
      # DOC-UPDATER has not run yet. That is the same one-pipeline-step lag the
      # 2026-09-11 (first) block already recorded as this mechanism's single
      # blind spot, now observed a second time -- and once again a
      # code-derived signal, not the status list, is what caught it. Two
      # independent firings, same mechanism, same lag. The redundancy is doing
      # exactly the work it was built for.
      #
      # WHAT THE RE-DERIVATION FOUND -- the disposition stays
      # :blocked_on_dependency, but the BLOCKER AND ITS OWNER HAVE CHANGED,
      # for the second time:
      #
      #   2026-09-09: blocked on "the entity subsystem has no HTTP surface"
      #                 (no router, no mount, no context module)  -- owner S10
      #   2026-09-11: blocked on "POST /entities/query does not exist"
      #                 (REQ-310 shipped definition CRUD + record WRITES only)
      #                                                            -- owner S10
      #   2026-09-11: blocked on "Letflow.Simulation.Runner dispatches no
      #    (this)      :gui step at all"                            -- owner S8
      #
      # The record READ path is now COMPLETE. Verified live, not assumed:
      #
      #   * Letflow.Routers.Entities.__authz_routes__/0 returns TEN routes,
      #     including {"POST", "/query", :EntitiesQuery} -- asserted positively
      #     below (Signal 3'' inverted);
      #   * that route is a real composing handler (Types -> Compiler ->
      #     Allowlist -> Cursor -> FieldGrants), not a stub;
      #   * :EntitiesQuery, REQ-309's vocabulary minted ahead of its route, is
      #     now CONSUMED by that route -- the "specified but unserved" state
      #     Signal 3''' existed to detect is over, so that signal is inverted
      #     too rather than deleted.
      #
      # ⛔ Letflow.Entities.Records STILL exports no read function, and that is
      # now EVIDENCE OF CORRECTNESS, not evidence of a gap. It is a
      # command-only context module BY DESIGN (design §1's "no route reads a
      # record by id"); the read path is the QUERY ROUTE, never a Records read
      # function. The previous round's Signal 3' asserted that absence as proof
      # the subsystem could not serve reads. That inference is now FALSE -- the
      # absence holds and reads ARE served -- so the assertion is KEPT but its
      # MEANING IS RESTATED (Signal 3' below): it now pins the design rule
      # itself, which a future `list_records/2` would violate.
      #
      # THE REMAINING BLOCKER IS THE HARNESS, AND IT IS GENUINELY INDEPENDENT.
      # The previous round deliberately recorded it as a SEPARATE evidence line
      # precisely so REQ-311 landing could not silently green this test. That
      # separation is what made this re-derivation honest instead of automatic:
      # the route blocker cleared, the harness blocker did not, and the two
      # were never conflated. test/support/simulation/runner.ex's run_steps/1
      # matches a bare `:gui ->` clause in `case step.via do`, with NO guard and
      # NO condition, building `outcome: :deferred_to_s8` and returning without
      # ever calling dispatch_api_step/4. Confirmed live this session:
      # runner.ex is not in this branch's diff, is unmodified in the working
      # tree, and all six of this scenario's fixture steps are `via: gui`.
      #
      # So the scenario STILL cannot execute -- but no longer because anything
      # is missing from lib/. Everything the six steps need over HTTP now
      # exists; the harness simply refuses to make the calls. That is S8's
      # frontend-cutover work, NOT S10's.
      #
      # ⛔ THE NEXT TRIPWIRE IS ARMED AGAINST THE RUNNER (Signal 5 below), not
      # against a route or a requirement id. See that signal for why it asserts
      # on OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR rather than on runner.ex's source text.
      #
      # ── PRESERVED HISTORY: the 2026-09-11 (first) re-derivation block ─────
      # Everything from here to the end of this banner is the previous round's
      # own reasoning, kept verbatim as the record of why THAT disposition held.
      # Its factual claims were true when written; the ones REQ-311 has since
      # falsified are marked, never deleted.
      #
      # DISPOSITION RE-DERIVED 2026-09-11, AFTER REQ-310 LANDED (f6e0ae64).
      #
      # The 2026-09-11 ⛔ block preserved below predicted exactly this moment
      # and instructed that the right response is to re-derive, never to
      # allowlist REQ-310. That is what happened here. The old disposition --
      # "the entity subsystem has no HTTP surface" -- is now FACTUALLY FALSE
      # and has been replaced, not patched:
      #
      #   * /entities IS mounted (api_pipeline.ex), Signal 1's old assertion
      #     inverted accordingly (Signal 1' below asserts the mount POSITIVELY);
      #   * both deferred-routes rows ARE gone from router.ex (Signal 1'');
      #   * Letflow.Routers.Entities exists and serves NINE real routes.
      #     [SUPERSEDED 2026-09-11 by REQ-311: it now serves TEN.]
      #
      # The scenario is nonetheless STILL BLOCKED, for a different and much
      # narrower reason, and the assertions below are correspondingly sharper
      # than the ones they replace:
      #
      #   ⇒ All six of this scenario's :gui steps are RECORD READS (list,
      #     filter x2, sort, page, field-level redaction -- see the fixture).
      #     Record reads happen ONLY through POST /entities/query
      #     (lib/letflow/design/req308-entity-http-surface.md:182, verbatim:
      #     "record reads only happen via /entities/query"), and that route is
      #     REQ-311's, still unbuilt. REQ-310 shipped definition CRUD plus
      #     record WRITES; there is no record read path anywhere -- not a
      #     route, and not even a context function to hang one off
      #     (Letflow.Entities.Records is command-only).
      #     [SUPERSEDED 2026-09-11 by REQ-311: POST /entities/query IS built
      #     and served, so the record read path IS complete. The clause about
      #     Records being command-only remains TRUE and is now correctness,
      #     not a gap -- see the banner above.]
      #
      # Signal 3 was ALSO rewritten rather than kept, because REQ-310 made it
      # a tautology: it asserted lib/letflow/entities.ex and
      # lib/letflow/entity_query.ex do not exist, and they still do not -- but
      # the subsystem shipped under lib/letflow/entities/ (a DIRECTORY:
      # definitions.ex, records.ex, entity_definition.ex, query/) and was never
      # going to occupy those two flat paths. Asserting their absence proved
      # the subsystem was unbuilt in 2026-09-09 and proves nothing at all
      # today. It is replaced by a capability check (Signal 3'): no read
      # function is exported by Letflow.Entities.Records.
      #
      # This test now also RUNS the scenario (Runner.run/1) rather than
      # recording steps_executed: 0 -- see Signal 4 and the disposition_report
      # at the bottom.

      # None of them mounts Letflow.Routers.Entities or Letflow.Routers.EntityQuery
      # -- that HTTP surface is S10's own gap 1. (That gap was unowned and unfiled
      # when this block was written on 2026-09-09; it is owned by REQ-308 as of
      # 2026-09-11 -- see the third UPDATE below. Still unmounted either way.)
      # Signal 3 below remains the real gate, and it was re-verified live rather
      # than assumed when this allowlist was extended: neither context module
      # exists, and both router rows are still in the reserved/unbuilt table.
      #
      # UPDATE (S10 gap 13, 2026-09-10): REQ-304 joins the allowlist. It adds an
      # entity_definitions section to Letflow.Definitions.SolutionPack's pack
      # document so a solution pack can CARRY an entity definition -- delivery,
      # not runtime. It mounts no route and builds no context module, so the

      # Signal 3 was re-verified live again here rather than assumed: still no
      # lib/letflow/entities.ex, no lib/letflow/entity_query.ex, no entity
      # router module under lib/letflow/routers/, and Letflow.Routers.Entities
      # still present only as a reserved/unbuilt row in router.ex.
      #
      # UPDATE (S10 gap 1, 2026-09-11): REQ-308 joins the allowlist. It is the
      # first requirement to actually OWN gap 1 -- the entity HTTP surface the
      # 2026-09-09 block above called "still unowned and unfiled" (that sentence
      # was true when written and is corrected in place above). REQ-308 is a
      # DESIGN requirement and nothing more: owner CODE-DESIGNER, its sole
      # artefact is a design document under lib/letflow/design/, and its own
      # description scopes it "exactly as REQ-295 and REQ-303 were: a design
      # artefact under lib/letflow/design/, no lib/ implementation, no route
      # mounted, no test". A design artefact mounts no route and builds no
      # context module, so the disposition is unaffected -- deciding the shape
      # of a surface is not the same as serving it. The requirement that
      # implements REQ-308's design is the one that will flip this scenario,
      # and it is not filed yet. Signal 3 was re-verified live here rather than
      # assumed, for the third time: no lib/letflow/entities.ex, no
      # lib/letflow/entity_query.ex, no entity router module among the sixteen
      # files under lib/letflow/routers/, both Entities/EntityQuery still only
      # reserved/unbuilt rows in router.ex, and api_pipeline.ex's forward list
      # still has no entities entry.
      #
      # UPDATE (S10 gap 1, 2026-09-11, second block of the same day): REQ-309
      # joins the allowlist, and this block additionally records a DATED WARNING
      # about REQ-310, which is the requirement that finally flips this test.
      #
      # REQ-309 first. It is the first implementation requirement built from
      # REQ-308's design (lib/letflow/design/req308-entity-http-surface.md §3),
      # and it is deliberately the vocabulary half of that design and nothing
      # more: it adds four permission atoms (:EntitiesDefinitionsRead,
      # :EntitiesDefinitionsWrite, :EntitiesRecordsWrite, :EntitiesQuery), the
      # matching endpoint_policy_key/2 clauses and the role_allows?/2 matrix
      # arms, all inside lib/letflow/api/authorization.ex. Its own scope fence
      # says it in as many words: "It creates no router, mounts no route,
      # touches no file under lib/letflow/routers/, does not edit
      # lib/letflow/router.ex or lib/letflow/plugs/api_pipeline.ex". A policy
      # key with no route consuming it is unreachable over HTTP -- the same
      # "ported ahead of its consuming route" state :DlqOperate and
      # :WebhooksManage already sat in. So the disposition is unaffected:
      # naming the permission that WOULD gate a surface is not serving that
      # surface. All three signals were re-verified live here rather than
      # assumed, for the fourth time: router.ex lines 82-83 still carry
      # `Letflow.Routers.Entities` / entities.zig and
      # `Letflow.Routers.EntityQuery` / entity_query.zig as rows in the
      # "## Deferred routes (not yet mounted -- added by owning stage)" table
      # and nowhere else; no lib/letflow/entities.ex; no
      # lib/letflow/entity_query.ex; no entity router among the sixteen files
      # under lib/letflow/routers/; and api_pipeline.ex's forward list (lines
      # 141-153) still forwards only identity, tenants, instances, definitions,
      # tasks, promotions, onboarding, solution-packs, audit, dlq, webhooks,
      # services and admin/services -- no /entities.

      # rows" -- filed, status pending, letflow-queue task 597) IS THE
      # REQUIREMENT THAT FLIPS THIS TEST. Its description, points 1, 5 and 7,
      # commits to exactly the three things this scenario's disposition rests on
      # being absent:
      #
      #   * point 1 creates lib/letflow/routers/entities.ex -> Signal 3 goes
      #     false (the context/router surface exists);
      #   * point 5 adds `forward("/entities", to: Letflow.Routers.Entities)` to
      #     lib/letflow/plugs/api_pipeline.ex -> the subsystem becomes reachable
      #     over HTTP;

      # WHEN REQ-310 LANDS, THIS SCENARIO'S BLOCKED_ON_DEPENDENCY DISPOSITION

      # scenario exercises will be live, so the scenario should actually RUN --
      # Runner.run/1 against entity-list-filter-and-page.yaml, its six :gui
      # steps executed and asserted -- rather than be recorded as blocked with
      # steps_executed == 0.
      #
      # ⛔ DO NOT "FIX" THE REQ-310 FAILURE BY ADDING "REQ-310" TO allowed_ids.
      # That is the wrong reflex and it is precisely the failure mode this
      # tripwire exists to prevent. The allowlist triages a requirement whose
      # TITLE mentions entities but which does not BUILD the subsystem; REQ-310
      # builds it. Admitting it to the allowlist would silence the title
      # assertion while leaving Signals 1 and 3 to fail anyway, and anyone who
      # then also "fixed" those would be left with a green test asserting a
      # disposition that is false -- a test actively certifying that a shipped,
      # mounted, HTTP-reachable subsystem is missing. That is worse than no test.
      #
      # WHOEVER IMPLEMENTS REQ-310 MUST RE-EVALUATE THIS SCENARIO'S DISPOSITION

      # bookkeeping with a real execution of the scenario, and update
      # lib/letflow/design/ §4.1/§4.3's disposition table to match. Route it

      # FILED in docs/requirements.yaml (pending, queue tasks 597 and 598), and
      # both carry entity titles, so this tripwire fires on them TODAY -- on the
      # mere filing, years before the code lands. Filing builds nothing, so the
      # disposition is still correct and they must be admitted. But admitting
      # them flatly would burn the warning above: the test would then stay green
      # straight through REQ-310 landing, and the only thing standing between a
      # mounted /entities and a test asserting it does not exist would be
      # whether someone read this comment. So they are admitted CONDITIONALLY,
      # in a second list the test checks against their live `status:` -- pending
      # passes, anything else fails loudly with these instructions. REQ-311
      # ("POST /entities/query", which REQ-310's §SCOPE explicitly defers to it)

      # ── 2026-09-11, AFTER REQ-310 LANDED: THIS TIER FIRED AS DESIGNED. ────
      #
      # It fired via Signal 1 rather than via the status check -- REQ-310's
      # CODE landed (f6e0ae64) while docs/requirements.yaml still reads
      # `status: pending`, because DOC-UPDATER had not yet run. Worth recording
      # plainly, because it is the mechanism's one real blind spot: `status:`
      # lags the code by one pipeline step, so the status check alone would NOT
      # have caught REQ-310. Signal 1 caught it. That redundancy is why the
      # tripwire was built with three independent signals and not just the
      # status list, and it is why Signal 1' above is now a POSITIVE assertion
      # on the mount rather than a negative one on the deferred rows.
      #
      # REQ-310 was NOT moved into allowed_ids to silence anything -- the ⛔
      # block above is explicit that doing so is the wrong reflex. It was moved
      # there only AFTER its disposition consequence was re-derived in full and
      # this whole describe block was rewritten to assert the new truth. The
      # pending-only tier's contract ("admitted only while it builds nothing")
      # no longer describes it: it HAS built something, that something was
      # triaged, and the triage is what produced the assertions above. REQ-309
      # moved for the ordinary reason -- it shipped permission vocabulary only,
      # which its own scope fence confirms builds no route.
      #
      # REQ-311 stays here, re-armed. It is now the sole remaining tripwire and
      # the requirement that will flip this scenario for real: it adds
      # POST /entities/query, the record-read route all six :gui steps need.
      #
      # ── 2026-09-11, AFTER REQ-311 LANDED: THIS TIER IS NOW EMPTY. ─────────
      #
      # REQ-311 was its last member, and it has been promoted to allowed_ids
      # above -- again on the strength of a completed re-derivation, never to
      # silence anything. So the honest question this round had to answer is
      # whether an empty tier still has a purpose, or whether it is dead code
      # dressed as a safety mechanism.
      #
      # ⛔ IT IS KEPT, EMPTY AND STILL ENFORCED, and that is a deliberate call
      # with a concrete reason -- not inertia.
      #
      # The tier's purpose was never "hold REQ-310 and REQ-311 specifically."
      # It is the mechanism by which a requirement that BUILDS this subsystem
      # can be admitted to the entity-title check WITHOUT its mere filing being
      # mistaken for its landing. That situation is not historical: S10's own
      # entity work is not finished (the query surface is one route of a larger
      # subsystem, and 0023's DDL-execution open question is still unanswered
      # and still gates further implementation requirements), so the NEXT such
      # requirement is a matter of when, not whether. Deleting the tier would
      # mean whoever files it has to reinvent this two-tier shape from scratch,
      # or -- far likelier, and the failure mode the ⛔ block above exists to
      # prevent -- drop the id straight into allowed_ids because that is the
      # path of least resistance and nothing structural argues otherwise.
      #
      # Kept empty, the tier costs one empty list and one `cond` arm that
      # currently never matches, and it keeps the correct procedure visible and
      # executable at the exact moment someone needs it. The `flunk` arm below
      # is what actually stops an unadmitted id either way, so an empty tier
      # weakens nothing.
      #
      # ⛔ WHAT TO DO WHEN YOU NEED THIS TIER AGAIN: add the id HERE, not to
      # allowed_ids, while it is still `status: pending`. The assertion below
      # then fires the moment it flips to done, handing the next agent these
      # instructions. Note the lag this mechanism has now demonstrated TWICE
      # (REQ-310, REQ-311): `status:` trails the code by one pipeline step, so
      # the status check is a BACKSTOP, never the primary detector. The primary
      # detectors are the code-derived signals below -- and Signal 5 in
      # particular, which is this round's new tripwire.

      # History, so the restatement is legible. The ORIGINAL Signal 3 asserted
      # lib/letflow/entities.ex and lib/letflow/entity_query.ex do not exist;
      # REQ-310 made that a tautology (the subsystem shipped under the
      # lib/letflow/entities/ DIRECTORY and was never going to occupy those two
      # flat paths), so the previous round replaced it with this capability
      # check and read it as: "no context function can read a record, therefore
      # no route can serve one, therefore the scenario is blocked."
      #
      # ⛔ THAT INFERENCE IS NOW FALSE, AND THE ASSERTION IS STILL RIGHT.
      # REQ-311's POST /entities/query serves record reads without any read
      # function on Letflow.Entities.Records -- it composes
      # Query.{Types,Compiler,Allowlist,Cursor,FieldGrants} instead. So the
      # premise "no read function ⇒ no read path" is dead, while the fact it
      # tested is not merely still true but is now a DESIGN RULE the shipped
      # code depends on.
      #
      # This assertion is therefore KEPT, with its meaning inverted from
      # evidence-of-a-gap to evidence-of-correctness: Letflow.Entities.Records
      # is command-only BY DESIGN (its own moduledoc; Letflow.Routers.Entities'
      # "No route reads a record by id, and none lists records"; design §1),
      # and record reads belong exclusively to the query route. A later
      # list_records/2 or get_record/3 appearing here would mean that rule was
      # abandoned -- a second, competing read path alongside /entities/query,
      # bypassing the FieldGrants redaction both of that route's branches
      # enforce (INV-2). That is worth failing on for its own sake, entirely
      # apart from this scenario's disposition.

      # ⛔ THIS IS THE ASSERTION THAT NOW CARRIES THE DISPOSITION, and the one
      # armed to fire when S8 makes :gui steps executable. Read the next three
      # paragraphs before touching it.
      #
      # THE BLOCKER. Letflow.Simulation.Runner.run_steps/1
      # (test/support/simulation/runner.ex) reduces over the scenario's steps
      # with `case step.via do`, and its `:gui ->` clause is a bare pattern
      # match -- no guard, no condition, no feature flag. It builds
      # `outcome: :deferred_to_s8` and returns, never reaching
      # dispatch_api_step/4. Every :gui step, in every scenario, unconditionally.
      # So even though POST /entities/query is now built, mounted and serving,
      # these six steps STILL do not execute: the harness will not make the
      # calls. That is S8's frontend-cutover work, a different owner and a
      # different stage from the S10 route work that just completed.
      #
      # WHY THIS ASSERTS ON OBSERVED BEHAVIOUR, NOT ON runner.ex's SOURCE TEXT.
      # The tempting version is `File.read!("runner.ex") =~ ":deferred_to_s8"`,
      # matching how Signals 1'/1'' read api_pipeline.ex and router.ex. It was
      # deliberately NOT written that way, for two reasons:
      #
      #   (a) BRITTLE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION -- it fires on edits that change
      #       nothing. A reformat, a renamed variable, a moved clause, a
      #       reworded detail string would all trip a text match while the
      #       harness behaves identically. A tripwire that cries wolf gets
      #       disarmed by the third person who hits it.
      #   (b) BLIND IN THE WRONG DIRECTION -- and this is the worse half. The
      #       text `:deferred_to_s8` would STILL APPEAR in runner.ex after S8
      #       makes GUI steps executable, because the natural shape of that
      #       change is a CONDITIONAL: dispatch when a GUI driver is available,
      #       fall back to :deferred_to_s8 when it is not. The literal would
      #       survive, the text assertion would stay green, and the exact
      #       transition this tripwire exists to catch would pass unnoticed.
      #
      # Asserting on what Runner.run/1 ACTUALLY DID to THIS scenario's steps
      # inverts both properties: it is silent through any refactor that
      # preserves behaviour, and it fires on any change that makes even ONE of
      # these six steps execute -- however that change is implemented, whether
      # by deleting the clause, guarding it, flagging it, or routing :gui
