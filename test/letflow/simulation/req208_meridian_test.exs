  REQ-208 acceptance criteria: 3 Meridian scenario YAMLs run through
  `Letflow.Simulation.Runner`.

  ## FIXED by ISS-0397 (2026-09-01) -- formerly a CRITICAL FINDING blocking full
  AC1/AC2 verification; superseding note added rather than deleting the
  original finding, per this project's discipline of not silently erasing a
  documented defect's own history

  `Letflow.Engine.complete_task/3`'s real, per-call state-rebuild
  (`lib/letflow/engine.ex`'s `build_instance_state/3`) used to hardcode
  `join_counters: %{}` on EVERY call, confirmed reproduced against a real
  running instance in the session that wrote this test (`Letflow.Engine.create/2`
  for the initial split, then a SEPARATE `Letflow.Engine.complete_task/3` call
  for the first branch's own completion -- real HTTP 500,
  `{:error, {:activation_failed, {:unknown_branch_id, _}}}` internally). A
  `PARALLEL_GATEWAY` join could therefore only ever fire within the SAME
  hop-chain call as its own split. **ISS-0397**
  (`lib/letflow/design/iss0397-join-counters-fix.md`) fixed this by adding a
  durable `instance_projections.join_counters` column, read/written under the
  same `FOR UPDATE` lock `complete_task/3`/`advance_after_timer_fired/3` already
  hold on that row -- a join cohort opened by one call is now durably readable
  (and closeable) by a later, separate call. The two tests below were updated
  accordingly (see each `describe` block's own comments) to assert the now-real,
  now-successful second-call behavior instead of the pre-fix HTTP 500 -- they no
  longer reproduce a defect, they lock in its fix.

  **Still NOT fully verified by this file's ORIGINAL two describe blocks below
  (unchanged since REQ-208, kept for their own historical/ISS-0397-fix-locking
  value, not rewritten):** AC1/AC2's own fuller claims (full quorum across all
  3 branches through to disbursement, EO-002's negative assertion) remain out
  of reach of a real end-to-end run there -- `disburse-loan`/
  `credit-committee-vote`/`l1-approval` sit behind `SERVICE_TASK` nodes this
  engine did not yet dispatch at the time those two describe blocks were
  written (§0.8/§3 below, a platform-wide gap REQ-206/207 already found,
  unrelated to ISS-0397).

  ## REQ-433 (2026-10-02) -- the "meridian-loan-origination-above-threshold"
  describe block IS rewritten, over this file's own prior "not rewritten"
  note above -- and surfaces a NEW, previously-undiscovered engine defect
  `lib/letflow/design/req433-committee-quorum.md`'s own §4.2 "Required
  follow-on" flagged this test module by name: the old single-HUMAN_TASK
  `credit-committee-vote`/`committee_outcome` shape is gone from both real
  fixtures and from `@simple_loan_origination_graph` below, replaced by a
  real 2-of-3 quorum subgraph (`committee-vote-fork`/
  `committee-vote-{cro,director,ceo}`/`committee-vote-join`/
  `committee-tally`). The extended
  `test/fixtures/simulation/meridian/scenarios/loan-origination-above-
  threshold.yaml` now carries 9 real steps (through the remaining assessment
  branch, both gateways, and all three committee votes) instead of 3.

  **The first 7 steps are real and pass**: 2 of 3 committee votes complete
  for real, reaching 2-of-3 quorum at the variable level (the join has not
  fired yet -- one branch still outstanding). **Step 8 (the 3rd, join-firing
  vote) reproduces a genuine, newly-discovered, previously-undocumented
  engine limitation** (full mechanism documented at that assertion's own
  comment, below): a `PARALLEL_GATEWAY` join whose own downstream edge
  leads directly to a `SERVICE_TASK`, when that join fires within the same
  hop chain as the triggering task completion, cannot create that
  `SERVICE_TASK`'s dispatch row (`build_complete_task_tail_multi/6`'s
  identity-`id_map` assumption for `prepared_service_task_dispatches` does
  not hold for a hop-chain-local, join-minted token -- confirmed by direct
  reproduction and source read, not guessed). REQ-433's own OUT OF SCOPE
  clause and AC6 forbid fixing `lib/letflow/engine/` here, so this describe
  block documents the real, reproducible failure (a 422) rather than
  fabricating a pass -- matching this same file's own established
  discipline for the pre-ISS-0397 defect it used to document the same way.
  This is a NEW platform-wide finding (every `PARALLEL_GATEWAY` join
  exercised anywhere else in this codebase routes into another gateway or a
  `HUMAN_TASK`, never a bare `SERVICE_TASK`) requiring its own
  CODE-DESIGNER-sized follow-up fix before REQ-433's AC4 can be genuinely
  closed end to end. The "meridian-loan-origination-below-threshold"
  describe block is NOT touched -- that scenario never reaches the
  committee branch at all.

  ## CLOSED by REQ-215 (2026-09-03) -- the SERVICE_TASK dispatch gap itself

  `Letflow.Engine.Transition.dispatch_node/4` now has a real `:SERVICE_TASK`
  clause (`lib/letflow/design/req215-service-task-engine-wiring.md`); REQ-214
  built the dispatch-core poller this requirement's re-entry function
  (`Letflow.Engine.advance_after_service_task_outcome/4`) hands a resolved
  outcome to. **REQ-215's own AC2 is exactly this file's own long-standing
  gap:** "`req208_meridian_test.exs`'s committee-vote/quorum-2-of-3/
  disbursement paths (previously unreached) are reached and pass end to
  end." The new `"meridian-loan-origination-above-threshold, full committee-
  vote quorum through disbursement (REQ-215 AC2)"` describe block below
  closes it -- a THIRD describe block, added rather than rewriting the first
  two (which independently lock in ISS-0397's own fix and stay valid,
  unchanged, on their own narrower claim). It exercises the real
  `credit-committee-vote` (HUMAN_TASK) -> `create-facility` (a REAL
  `SERVICE_TASK` node now, not elided) -> `disburse-loan` (HUMAN_TASK) path,
  driven via direct `Letflow.Engine`/`Letflow.Tasks` API calls (not
  `Runner.run/1` against the existing scenario YAMLs, which have no step
  primitive for "resolve a pending SERVICE_TASK dispatch" and were never
  updated past the point they originally truncated at -- extending the YAML
  format itself is out of REQ-215's own scope). `attempt_dispatch/2` +
  `advance_after_service_task_outcome/4` are called directly rather than via
  `ServiceTaskDispatcher.poll_and_dispatch/1`, since `poll_and_dispatch/1`
  currently crashes on a genuine `:advance` outcome -- see
  `test/letflow/engine/service_task_wiring_test.exs`'s own "DEFECT" describe
  block for the full report; not re-derived here, just avoided the same way
  that file's own working tests avoid it.

  ## SERVICE_TASK limitation (design §0.8/§3, same platform-wide gap REQ-206/207
  already found) -- applies ONLY to the original two describe blocks below,
  NOT to the new third one (which restores a real SERVICE_TASK node, above)
  `Letflow.Engine` did not yet dispatch SERVICE_TASK nodes as of REQ-208. The
  real `process_claim_intake.yaml`/`process_policy_binding.yaml` fixtures have
  SERVICE_TASKs on their critical paths. Test-local simplified process graphs
  (`@simple_loan_origination_graph`, `@simple_regulatory_review_graph`) replace
  them with direct edges/END nodes, mirroring REQ-206/207's own precedent
  exactly -- unchanged, since rewriting those two would lose their own
  historical ISS-0397-fix-locking value.

  ## Token roles are a separate namespace from process `attributes.role` strings
  (design §0.7, re-confirmed this session)
  `HUMAN_TASK` node `attributes.role` values (e.g. `"role-credit-manager"`,
  `"role-committee-member"`) are engine-internal `assignee_ref` strings, never
  a token permission -- `Identity.create_token/3` (`lib/letflow/identity.ex`)
  accepts ONLY `Authorization.roles/0`'s 5 literal values
  (PLATFORM_ADMIN/PROCESS_DESIGNER/PROCESS_OPERATOR/TASK_WORKER/AGENT_RUNNER),
  confirmed empirically this session (`{:error, :invalid_role_set}` on a
  `role-*` string). Every actor below is granted `PROCESS_OPERATOR`
  (matching REQ-206/207's own precedent) -- per §0.7, claim is not required
  before complete.

  (ISS-0942 update: the sentence this note used to end on --
  "`:TasksComplete` unconditionally allows any `PROCESS_OPERATOR`-permissioned
  actor to complete any task regardless of its `assignee_ref`" -- was the
  exact gap ISS-0942 closed (this fixture's own `role-*` HUMAN_TASK
  attributes were the live-UAT-exploited case, meridian/regulatory-
  compliance-review-bafin). `POST /tasks/:id/complete` now additionally
  enforces `Tasks.authorize_completion/3` ahead of
  `Engine.complete_task/3` -- a `PROCESS_OPERATOR` token alone is no longer
  sufficient; the calling user must also actually hold/belong to the
  task's `USER`/`GROUP`/`ROLE` assignee. This is why the setup below now
  also seeds each `org_structure.yaml` department as a real group and binds
  the `role-*` names this fixture's HUMAN_TASK nodes use to the department
  whose member actually drives that step.)

  ## REQ-199 status at execution time (AC4)
  `docs/requirements.yaml` REQ-199 entry: `status: done`, stage S6 (re-confirmed
  this session, design §0.5). Material caveat stated regardless: `Runner.run_steps/1`
  dispatches every `:api` step sequentially -- this run does not itself generate
  genuinely concurrent out-of-band completions and therefore does not
  independently re-exercise REQ-199's ORD-01/02/03 guards under real concurrent
  load. It exercises only that the parallel-fork/join graph SHAPE transitions
  correctly under one-at-a-time completions (a real, valuable engine-instance-shape
  test, not the same claim as "no lost update under concurrent completions"). See
  design §0.5/§7 -- a follow-up issue recommendation is reported via
  `result.issues` at handoff time (checked against ISS-0388..0393 first, per
  the requirement's own instruction; not a duplicate).

  # ── §3.1: @simple_loan_origination_graph ──────────────────────────────────
  # Derived from process_claim_intake.yaml (design §0.2), SERVICE_TASK nodes
  # elided/replaced: credit-memo-timeout/risk-assessment-timeout/kyc-timeout
  # (on_timeout fallbacks) elided entirely; l2-approval's approve branch
  # replaced by a direct edge straight to disburse-loan; decline-application
  # replaced by a direct edge to end-declined. Every HUMAN_TASK/
  # EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY/PARALLEL_GATEWAY node and every condition string on the
  # real, exercised path kept verbatim -- EXCEPT the KYC/AML branch, per the
  # ELIXIR-DEV finding below.
  #
  # REQ-433 update: the old single-HUMAN_TASK `credit-committee-vote`/
  # `committee_outcome` shape is replaced by the real 2-of-3 quorum subgraph
  # (`committee-vote-fork`/`committee-vote-{cro,director,ceo}`/
  # `committee-vote-join`/`committee-tally`), mirroring
  # lib/letflow/design/req433-committee-quorum.md §2 exactly (minus the
  # per-voter timeout SERVICE_TASK siblings, elided consistent with this
  # graph's own convention). `create-facility` is the one exception to this
  # graph's SERVICE_TASK elision: it is kept real so the committee-tally
  # approve path (`e39`) parks there for real, matching
  # @loan_origination_graph_with_service_task's own already-proven shape.
  #
  # ELIXIR-DEV finding, over the design's own §3.1 plan (design proposed
  # replacing kyc-aml-check with a direct edge from parallel-assessment-fork
  # to kyc-routing, an EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY, keeping kyc-routing/kyc-manual-review
  # real): empirically, this does not activate. `Letflow.Engine.create/2`
  # returns `{:error, {:activation_failed, {:no_matching_join_found,
  # "parallel-assessment-fork"}}}` -- confirmed this session by direct
  # reproduction against a real running instance. Reading
  # `lib/letflow/engine/transition.ex`'s `find_matching_join/2` and
  # `walk_to_gateway/3` (REQ-051's own fork/join implementation) shows every
  # fork branch must be a chain of SINGLE-outgoing-edge nodes until it reaches
  # the PARALLEL_GATEWAY join -- a node with more than one outgoing edge
  # (kyc-routing, an EXCLUSIVE_GATEWAY with 3 outgoing edges) makes
  # `walk_to_gateway/3` return `:error` before ever reaching assessment-join,
  # which fails the WHOLE split (not just that branch) at instance-creation
  # time. This is a genuine, previously-undocumented Engine limitation --
  # distinct from the SERVICE_TASK-not-dispatched gap REQ-206/207/208's design
  # docs already record -- reported via `result.issues` at handoff time (new
  # finding, checked against ISS-0388..0393 first; not a duplicate).
  #
  # Resolution here: the KYC/AML branch is a single, unconditioned, immediate
  # edge from parallel-assessment-fork straight to assessment-join (no
  # kyc-routing/kyc-manual-review nodes in this simplified graph at all) --
  # both scenarios' own `kyc_status: "clear"` value would have taken
  # kyc-routing's own `== 'clear'` edge straight to assessment-join anyway
  # (design §3.1's own edge table), so no scenario-observable behavior is
  # lost; only the (never-exercised-by-either-scenario, per design §3.1's own
  # table) kyc-manual-review branch is now structurally absent rather than
  # present-but-unreached. `kyc_status` is dropped from both scenarios'
  # `initial_variables` accordingly (it would be inert dead data otherwise).

  # instead of being elided the way @simple_loan_origination_graph elides

  # KYC/AML track's own edge, eligibility-gate, authority-routing, l1/l2
  # approval chain, credit-committee-vote) is kept identical to
  # @simple_loan_origination_graph above -- this graph exists ONLY to prove
  # REQ-215's own AC2 (committee-vote/quorum-2-of-3/disbursement paths
  # reached and passing end to end), not to re-prove anything the original

      # already-persisted token, as this same file's REQ-215 AC2 describe
      # block below proves) -- it does NOT hold here: `prepared_service_task_
      # dispatches` is computed from the hop chain's `final_instance_state`
      # BEFORE `insert_hop_chain_new_token_records/5` mints a real TokenRecord
      # for the join's own synthetic continuation token, and
      # `rewrite_token_ids/2` (which DOES fix up `final_instance_state.tokens`/
      # `.pending_task_nodes` for exactly this reason, per its own ISS-0408
      # moduledoc) never touches `prepared_service_task_dispatches` (or
      # `prepared_timers`, same bug, unexercised here) at all. The result: a
      # real `Ecto.Changeset` cast failure
      # (`token_id: {"is invalid", [type: Ecto.UUID, validation: :cast]}`)
      # building the `ServiceTaskDispatch` row, surfaced to the HTTP caller as
      # a real `422 Unprocessable Entity` ("validation failed").
      #
      # This is a genuine, previously-undiscovered engine limitation: "a
      # PARALLEL_GATEWAY join whose own downstream edge leads directly to a
      # SERVICE_TASK, when that join fires within the same hop chain as the
      # triggering task completion, cannot create that SERVICE_TASK's
      # dispatch row." REQ-433's committee-vote-join -> committee-tally ->
      # create-facility subgraph is the first shape in this codebase to
      # combine those two properties (every existing PARALLEL_GATEWAY join's
      # own downstream target has so far always been another gateway or a
      # HUMAN_TASK, never a bare SERVICE_TASK) -- confirmed by a repo-wide
