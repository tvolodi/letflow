defmodule Letflow.Supervisor.PollersTest do
  @moduledoc """
  REQ-219 (design `req219-supervision-layering.md` §4/§5/§6/§8): AC2 (a
  genuine cold-boot ordering test), AC4 (crash-loop isolation), and AC7
  (empty-children-list under `config/test.exs`'s current gates).

  `async: false` -- mutates global `Application` config and, uniquely
  among this module's tests, the AC2 test stops/restarts the ENTIRE
  `:letflow` OTP application. Leans on the same ExUnit scheduling
  guarantee `test/support/admission_test_helpers.ex`'s moduledoc already
  documents and relies on for a lighter-weight single-singleton restart:
  all `async: true` modules finish before any `async: false` module
  starts, and `async: false` modules run strictly one at a time relative
  to each other -- so no other test's Sandbox checkout against
  `Letflow.Repo` can be in flight while this module's AC2 test tears it
  down and restarts it.

  Test order in this file is deliberate (not enforced by ExUnit, but
  written in this order per the design doc's own suggestion): AC7, then
  AC4, then AC2 last, since AC2 is the one test in this design that
  stops/restarts the whole application -- running it last avoids
  perturbing the others with an extra full-app restart.

  ## Design doc §9 Q4 -- empirically resolved

  The design's own open question (whether `:logger.add_primary_filter/2`
  raises, vs. silently ignores, a duplicate filter id) was left unverified
  because that design environment had no reachable Elixir/OTP runtime.
  This environment does: running the AC2 test below WITHOUT its
  `:logger.remove_primary_filter/1` defensive step (a temporary local
  edit, reverted before this commit) completed with **no raise and no
  logged error** on this project's pinned toolchain (Elixir 1.20.3 / OTP
  29) -- `:logger.add_primary_filter/2` is a silent no-op (or an ignored
  error return) on a duplicate id here, not a raise, contrary to the
  original inline comment's own stated assumption in
  `lib/letflow/application.ex`. The defensive removal step is kept anyway,
  per the design's own reasoning: it is a no-op-safe call either way, and
  keeping it is more faithful to that comment's "exactly once per node"
  assumption than silently relying on this one runtime's observed
  behavior, which is not itself an OTP-documented contract.
