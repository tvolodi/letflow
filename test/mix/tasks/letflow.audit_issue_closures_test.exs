defmodule Mix.Tasks.Letflow.AuditIssueClosuresTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression coverage for ISS-0279 -- `mix letflow.audit_issue_closures`
  (`lib/mix/tasks/letflow.audit_issue_closures.ex`).

  Spec: `test/specs/ISS-0279.md`. Design:
  `lib/letflow/design/iss0279-issue-closure-audit.md`.
  Run: `WF03-ISS0279-20260822`, WF-03 Step 4.

  ## Why this is the MUTATION-required case, not the ordinary fail-then-pass case

  This is a wholly NET-NEW module -- `classify/1`, `tracked_issues/1`,
  `grandfathered?/1` did not exist pre-fix at all. A pre-fix run of this suite
  fails with `UndefinedFunctionError`/`Mix.NoTaskError` for every test in the
  file, which proves the module is new and nothing whatever about whether these
  tests discriminate a correct implementation from a wrong one (a suite can fail
  against a missing module and still be vacuous against a broken one). Per
  `docs/agents/workflows/WF-03_issue_resolving.md`'s "When the pre-fix failure is
  'the code under test does not exist'" section, the fail-first requirement here
  is satisfied ONLY by mutating the shipped logic and recording which tests fail
  per mutant -- see this run's `handoffs/WF03-ISS0279-20260822/step-04-test-designer.json`
  `result.summary` for the two mutants applied to `classify/1`, their per-test
  pass/fail counts, and the verified revert.

  ## No live `gh` / network call anywhere in this file

  * `tracked_issues/1` is exercised against fabricated `docs/issues/*.yaml`-shaped
    fixture files written to a tmp dir per test -- never the real `docs/issues/`
    corpus's live GitHub state (the real corpus IS read by
    `F-TRACKED-REAL-CORPUS-NO-CRASH` below, but only to prove parsing doesn't
    crash on real file content -- it asserts shape invariants only, never a `gh`
    fact).
  * `classify/1` is exercised directly with fabricated gh-JSON-shaped maps --
    the exact shapes documented in the module's own `@moduledoc` (`comments` as
    a bare array vs. a `%{"totalCount" => n}` object, matching the two live `gh`
    response shapes the module's Discovery notes describes).
  * `grandfathered?/1` is private with no exported test seam (confirmed: only
    `tracked_issues/1`, `fetch_issue/1`, and `classify/1` carry `@spec`/are
    `def`, not `defp`, in the shipped module) and `run/1` hardcodes
    `@issues_dir` internally, so it cannot be pointed at a fixture dir.
    `describe "grandfathered?/1 membership -- integration via run/1 with a
    faked gh"` below exercises it end-to-end against the REAL `docs/issues/`
    corpus (never mutated, never touched) by monkey-patching this OS process's
    `PATH` so `System.cmd("gh", ...)` inside `fetch_issue/1` resolves to a
    fixture script this test controls, restored via `on_exit`. Two REAL,
    already-tracked GitHub issue numbers are targeted: `68` (already a real
    `@grandfathered` entry, traced to `docs/issues/ISS-0012.yaml`) and `15`
    (a real tracked number, `docs/issues/ISS-0009.yaml`, NOT in
    `@grandfathered`). Every other real tracked number gets a fixture `OPEN`
    response so it never becomes a violation and never pollutes the assertion.
    This is real integration coverage of `grandfathered?/1`'s actual behavior on
    two real, named numbers -- not a mock replacing the function under test.
