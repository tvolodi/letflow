defmodule Mix.Tasks.Letflow.CheckIssueRefsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Covers `mix letflow.check_issue_refs`, which enforces ISSUE_QUEUE.md's
  "Numbering schema": three registries number independently from 1, so every
  cross-reference carries its registry's prefix.

  Two halves, matching the sibling registration/staleness checks' own shape:

    * **Rule tests** drive `audit/2` with fixture content, one rule at a time,
      including the two-sided "offender fails / bystander passes" pairing that
      `web/tests/guards/meta-control.spec.ts` uses — a detector that never
      fires and a detector that always fires are equally useless.

    * **T-LIVE-\\*** run the real `docs/issues/` corpus, so the suite fails if
      the tree itself drifts. That is the half that would have caught the
      superseded `ISS-NNNN == queue id` rule decaying to 172/305, which
      nothing re-checked for three weeks.
