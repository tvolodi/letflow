  Regression coverage for ISS-0231 -- `mix letflow.check_requirements_registration`
  (`lib/mix/tasks/letflow.check_requirements_registration.ex`).

  Spec: `test/specs/ISS-0231.md`. Design:
  `lib/letflow/design/iss0231-requirement-registration-drift-detection.md`,
  built to its section 7.4 **as amended by section 11.4 (MAJOR-1) and section
  11.7 (MINOR-1/-3/-5)**, which supersede the design body where they differ.
  Run: `WF03-ISS0231-20260822`, WF-03 Step 4.

  ## Why this suite is almost entirely hermetic

  The fix ADDS a module, so the pre-fix failure of every test here is
  `UndefinedFunctionError` -- which proves the module is new and nothing
  else. WF-03's "when the pre-fix failure is 'the code under test does not
  exist'" clause therefore governs: discrimination has to be demonstrated by
  mutating the shipped logic, and the tests have to be shaped so the mutants
  actually go red.

  Design section 7.2 (independently re-derived by CODE-DESIGN-VALIDATOR in
  section 11.1) is the load-bearing constraint: under **M1** -- the mutant
  that reproduces the ISS-0231 bug verbatim, a classifier that treats any
  attributed `impl_order` line as `:registered` -- the live
  `docs/requirements.yaml` still satisfies R1, R2 and R5, so a suite built
  only against the live corpus is vacuous against the very bug this fix
  exists to prevent.

  **That argument is now strictly stronger than when it was written, and the
  reason is worth recording.** When the design was authored the live corpus
  was 111 entries with 21 `:deferred`. Mid-run a sibling session landed
  `c84c27a` (PR #495), registering REQ-115..139. On this branch the live
  corpus classifies as:

      115 entries = 115 registered + 0 deferred + 0 neither + 0 unclassified

  With **zero** deferred entries there is nothing left on the live corpus for
  M1 to misclassify -- M1 produces *no visible change at all* against the real
  file. M1 is now detectable **only** by hermetic fixtures. The same collapse
  hits **M5** (`:deferred` promoted to hard-fail), whose only detector in the
  design was the live corpus: with 0 deferred entries the live file is green
  under M5 too, so `F-DEFERRED-GREEN` below carries that detection instead.

  The consequence, stated plainly so no future reader mistakes the live tests
  for coverage: **the hermetic fixture group is the whole test.** The
  `T-LIVE-*` tests below are invariant smoke tests over the real corpus. They
  are deliberately not pinned to today's 115/115/0/0/0 (those numbers move
  legitimately whenever a stage is registered or a requirement is added), and
  none of them is cited as the detector for any mutant.

  ## What happened to T-ROSTER

  Design section 7.4 specified `T-ROSTER` against the live corpus, and section
  11.6's OQ-5 ruling revised it to the unpinned form: `render/1`'s output on
  the real file "names at least one id, **the printed deferred count is
  greater than zero**, and every id printed in the roster appears in the
  `:deferred` bucket of the same report".

  As specified, that test **fails on this branch** -- the printed deferred
  count is zero. Section 11.6 anticipated exactly this and ruled in advance
  what such a failure means: *"the deferred set is now empty, confirm that is
  intended and retire this test", not "regression".* It is intended: `c84c27a`
  registered the entire deferred set through real `register_task` calls.

  So `T-ROSTER` is **retired in its live-corpus form and the property it was
  protecting is relocated, not deleted.** The property -- *the printed roster
  and the classification agree* -- now lives in two places:

    * `F-ROSTER-AGREEMENT`, a hermetic fixture with a deliberately non-empty
      deferred set, where the property holds permanently and where it is
      genuinely discriminating (it goes red under M1). This is the real test.
    * `T-ROSTER-LIVE-AGREEMENT`, the same property stated *conditionally* over
      the live corpus, deriving its expectation from the report instead of
      pinning a count: empty deferred set implies the "none" line, non-empty
      implies every deferred id is printed with a matching total. That form is
      true of any corpus and never goes stale.

  ## Two other decisions worth stating

  **`classify_entry([])` raises.** The function has no `[]` clause, so an
  empty entry crashes with `FunctionClauseError` rather than returning. That
  is unreachable from `scan/1` (the splitter only ever emits lists whose head
  is the `- id:` line), so it is characterised here rather than treated as a
  defect -- see `F-CLASSIFY-EMPTY`. No helper in this file can produce it.

  **LF heredoc-style fixtures are safe against a CRLF corpus.** The real
  `docs/requirements.yaml` is CRLF; every fixture here is LF. `F-CRLF` pins
  that the two produce structurally identical entries with no `\\r` leaking
  into any rationale, so the LF fixtures are not testing a different parser
  than the one the live file exercises.

  ## Fixtures carry a `stages:` section on purpose

  `doc/1` wraps every fixture body in a realistic two-key file. That is not
  decoration: it makes every count assertion in this file sensitive to **M9**
  (section guard removed), because under M9 the stage entries are swept into
  `entry_count`. `F-STAGES-SECTION` states that as a named assertion in the
  stronger form required by section 11.7 MINOR-5.
