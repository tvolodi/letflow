  @moduledoc """
  Coverage for REQ-358 -- `mix letflow.check_uat_scenario_schema`
  (`lib/mix/tasks/letflow.check_uat_scenario_schema.ex`).

  Spec: `test/specs/REQ-358.md`. Design:
  `lib/letflow/design/req358-uat-scope-branching-env.md` §2 (mechanical rules
  SCHEMA-1..6), §1.2 (the `scope`/`company_id` default-derivation rule) and §3
  (the login-routing throwaway fixture). Run: `WF02-REQ358-20260916`, WF-02
  Step 3.

  This is a WF-02 (new-code) requirement, not a WF-03 regression, so the
  fail-first-against-pre-fix-code discipline does not apply here -- the
  module under test is genuinely new and there is no prior "broken" version
  to run these tests against. Instead, every fixture below is built so that a
  concrete, plausible bug in `check_scenario/2` would turn it red; each test
  says which SCHEMA rule it pins and, where useful, names the specific
  mistake it would catch (e.g. "an implementation that only checks
  `scope:` and never falls back to `company_id:`" for the backward-compat
  fixtures).

  ## What this suite intentionally does NOT test

  `check_scenario/2` and `check_file/1` are exhaustively covered here. The
  module has **no branch-evaluation/branch-matching function** -- confirmed
  by reading `lib/mix/tasks/letflow.check_uat_scenario_schema.ex` in full:
  its only exported functions are `run/1`, `check_file/1`, `check_scenario/2`
  and `render/1`, none of which pick a branch or evaluate a `when:` condition
  against an observed fact. Branch *evaluation* (which of
  `platform_admin_dashboard` / `tenant_user_dashboard` /
  `unauthenticated_fallback` actually runs for a given session) is
  UAT-RUNNER's own runtime job against a live role/session, per
  `.claude/agents/uat-runner.md`'s "Evaluating a `when:` branch" section (design
  §4.3) -- it is a Claude subagent reading procedural markdown against a real
  HTTP session, not an Elixir function, and is not unit-testable here. This
  suite proves AC4's *schema* half only: the login-routing fixture's
  three-branch shape is valid under SCHEMA-1..6. The runtime-evaluation half
  is exercised by a real UAT-RUNNER run against QA, dispatched separately
  (not this step's job -- see the REQ-358 task description).
