defmodule Letflow.Scripts.TestParallelEnvGuardTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Q-1037 / GH #2364 regression guard: a test that drives the real parallel-runner shell
  script or calls the check.test Mix task's `run/1` inherits the `TEST_PARALLEL_*` variables
  of a sharded CI job unless it scrubs them. This guard fails when such a test file does not
  reference the scrub helper module. There is NO allow-list.

  ## Detection rule (per file under `test/**/*.{ex,exs}`)

  First the source is reduced to "code": triple-quote heredocs (moduledocs, docs, multi-line
  strings) and whole-line `#` comments are dropped. Then a file is a SPAWN SITE when either

    * (A) a string literal in the code ENDS in the script's file name (a path such as
      `Path.expand("../../scripts/<script>", __DIR__)`) AND the code contains a process
      spawn primitive (`System.cmd(`, `System.shell(`, `Port.open(`, `:os.cmd(`); or
    * (B) the code calls the check.test task module's `run(` function, or runs the
      `"letflow.check.test"` task through `Mix.Task.run/rerun`.

  A spawn site must contain the code token for the helper module. A spawner reached only
  through another helper function is covered when that function's file uses the scrub helper
  (that file is itself a spawn site under rule A).

  ## Blind spots (deliberate, documented)

    * A script path assembled at runtime (concatenation, `Path.join/2` pieces), or a command
      string such as `"bash <path> --x"` that does not END in the script name.
    * A spawn via a primitive not listed above, or via a helper module living outside `test/`.
    * An aliased call to the check.test task module (`alias ...Check.Test` then `Test.run(`).
    * Spawns written inside a heredoc (heredocs are stripped as docs) and a helper-module
      mention in a trailing comment (counts as a reference).
    * Shell harnesses (`test/**/*.sh`) -- not run by ExUnit; they set their own env.
    * The check proves the helper is REFERENCED, not that it is applied to every spawn in the
      file; per-variable behaviour is pinned by `test_parallel_env_test.exs` and by the
      env-sensitive tests themselves.

  This file's own source avoids matching its own rule (patterns are built from fragments),
  which is what keeps the allow-list empty.
