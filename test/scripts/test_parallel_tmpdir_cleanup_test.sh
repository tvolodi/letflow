# Regression test for ISS-0699: scripts/test_parallel.sh's Step 1.7 `tmp_dir`
# (mktemp -d, holding per-partition create/migrate + test logs) was never
# removed on ANY exit path -- no trap existed anywhere in the file -- leaking
# one directory per invocation (~280 accumulated on the host that filed the
# issue). See docs/issues/ISS-0699.yaml and
# lib/letflow/design/iss0699-test-parallel-tmpdir-cleanup-fix.md. The fix adds
# a `cleanup_tmp_dir` function plus `trap cleanup_tmp_dir EXIT`, registered
# immediately after `tmp_dir` is created: on a clean run (exit 0) with
# TEST_PARALLEL_KEEP_LOGS unset, tmp_dir is removed; on any nonzero exit, or
# on a clean exit with TEST_PARALLEL_KEEP_LOGS set, tmp_dir is preserved.
#
# Same extraction technique as test/scripts/test_parallel_pool_sizing_test.sh
# (ISS-0287): this does NOT hand-duplicate the trap/cleanup logic. It
# extracts the real `cleanup_tmp_dir` function + `tmp_dir=$(mktemp -d ...)` +
# `trap cleanup_tmp_dir EXIT` + the following echo line VERBATIM out of the
# real scripts/test_parallel.sh (bounded between the `cleanup_tmp_dir() {`
# line and the following `max_concurrent_creates=` line), and `eval`s that
# extracted block in a controlled subshell that fakes a fast exit (0 or 1)
# instead of actually running mix/postgres -- per this handoff's own
# instruction that a full real invocation isn't available in this
# environment. A real `mktemp -d` directory IS created by the extracted
# block itself (that line is part of what's under test), so this test
# verifies the real mechanism end to end: does a real directory that the
# real extracted code created actually get removed, or not, under each of
# the three dispositions.
#
# Usage: test/scripts/test_parallel_tmpdir_cleanup_test.sh
# Optional: TEST_PARALLEL_SCRIPT=<path> to point at a different copy of
# test_parallel.sh (used for this test's own pre-fix/post-fix fail-then-pass
# verification -- see the WF-03 handoff for how this was invoked against a
# pre-fix copy of the script).

# --- Extract the cleanup_tmp_dir function + tmp_dir/trap lines verbatim ---
#
# Start marker: the literal `cleanup_tmp_dir() {` function-definition line.
# End marker: the literal `max_concurrent_creates=` line that immediately
# follows the block under test in the real script (see script lines
# 261-278 as of this writing). Two independent guards close the
# over-capture gap, same shape as test_parallel_pool_sizing_test.sh's own
# guards:
#
#   1. The awk program tracks whether it was still "flag"-active when it hit
#      the end marker (closed=1, explicit exit 0) vs. ran off EOF without
#      ever closing (END block, explicit exit 1) -- checked via awk's own
#      process exit code, not inferred from the captured text.
#   2. Even if (1) were bypassed, the captured block is positively bounded
#      before eval: it must be <= 40 lines (the real block is 16 lines as of
#      this writing; 40 gives margin for comment growth while remaining far
#      short of what an EOF over-capture into Step 2/3/4/5 would produce),
#      and must NOT contain any token unique to Step 1.7's create/migrate
#      loop or later ("ecto.create", "ecto.migrate", "declare -A",
#      "wait -n", "# --- Step 2", "# --- Step 3", "# --- Step 4",
#      "# --- Step 5"). Either check tripping is a hard, loud failure with
#      no eval attempted.
#
# Against the PRE-FIX script (no cleanup_tmp_dir function, no trap
# anywhere), the start marker is never found, `flag` is never set, `closed`
# stays unset, and the awk program exits 1 off EOF -- this test correctly
# FAILS against pre-fix code via this same extraction step, not just via a
# separate "trap missing" assertion.
