defmodule Letflow.Scripts.TestParallelWatchdogOrphanTest do
  @moduledoc """
  CI-gate stall regression: `scripts/test_parallel.sh` starts one background watchdog
  subshell per partition (`sleep "$TEST_PARALLEL_PARTITION_TIMEOUT_S"`, default 1800 s,
  then TERM/KILL the partition's process group). When a partition finished, the script
  only did `kill <watchdog subshell pid>`, which does NOT kill the subshell's `sleep`
  child. That orphaned `sleep` inherited the script's stdout/stderr pipe, and the reader
  of that pipe -- `mix letflow.check.test` reads the script through an Erlang `Port` with
  `:exit_status`, which is only delivered once the pipe reaches EOF -- blocked until the
  sleep expired (measured on CI run 37641894774: partitions done 15:27:29, task returned
  15:35:36 = 8m07s, i.e. watchdog start + 1800 s).

  The fix kills the watchdog's whole process group (`kill -- -$pid`, falling back to
  `kill $pid`) at the post-`wait` site (Step 3) and in the EXIT trap.

  ## What is driven

  The REAL `scripts/test_parallel.sh` under bash, with a stub `mix` (and `psql`) first on
  `PATH` so no compile, database or real test run happens. The invocation is made through
  `Port.open/2` with `:exit_status` + `:stderr_to_stdout` -- exactly how
  `Mix.Tasks.Letflow.Check.Test` reads it -- and the primary assertion is the elapsed time
  until `{:exit_status, _}` arrives: seconds, versus the watchdog timeout (`@timeout_s`
  = 240 s here; an orphaned sleep would hold the pipe that long).

  The script runs inside `bash -c "set -o pipefail; bash script | cat"`. On Linux the Port
  alone only reports the exit status at pipe EOF, but on Windows erts reports it from the
  process handle without waiting for EOF -- the first version of this test passed against
  the BUGGY script there (the orphans only showed up as an 11 minute `mix test | grep`
  stall). A shell pipeline waits for EOF on every platform, so the bound is discriminating
  everywhere; `pipefail` keeps the script's own exit status.

  Cases:

    1. success: partitions exit 0 -> script exits 0 promptly, no orphan `sleep`
       (Step 3 site)
    2. failing partition: script exits non-zero (the log-dump path) and also promptly
    3. EXIT-trap site: the script aborts (`exit 1`) while a partition's watchdog is
       still running (admission-control abort) -> non-zero and prompt; only the trap's
       watchdog kill can release the pipe here
    4. Step 3 site in isolation: a finished partition's watchdog sleep is gone while a later
       partition is still running (the trap would only reap it at exit)
    5. hung partition: the watchdog must still TERM the partition group after
       `TEST_PARALLEL_PARTITION_TIMEOUT_S` -> script exits non-zero within seconds

  Needs a real `bash`; on Windows set `UAT_PF_BASH` (or `TEST_PARALLEL_BASH`) to git-bash.
  `async: false`: the cases spawn process trees and are timing-sensitive.
