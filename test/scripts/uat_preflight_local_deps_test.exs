defmodule Letflow.Scripts.UatPreflightLocalDepsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  ISS-0915 regression: `scripts/uat_preflight.sh`'s `local_deps` check must not report a
  false GAP when a spec file merely mentions "docker compose"/"docker exec"/"psql" as
  PROSE inside a quoted string literal (e.g. a `console.log(...)` message or an assertion
  string) -- that is not an executable invocation. ISS-0909(b) already fixed the sibling
  case of a prose mention inside a `/* */` or `//` comment; this covers the string-literal
  case RELEASE-VALIDATOR found while re-verifying that fix (PR #2051).

  The check must still GAP on a genuine invocation: either the literal keyword appearing
  in bare executable code (not inside a comment or string), or a call to db-exec.ts's
  `runSqlAgainstDevPostgres(...)` helper, which is call-expression syntax (never string
  content) and is therefore unaffected by the string-stripping fix.

  Shells out to the real script (no re-implementation of the regex), same harness shape as
  test/scripts/uat_preflight_bare_jwt_test.exs. Needs a real `bash`; on Windows set
  `UAT_PF_BASH` to git-bash.
