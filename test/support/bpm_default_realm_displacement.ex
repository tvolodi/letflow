  REQ-370 rework (TEST-RUNNER report `test/reports/report-20260918-WF02REQ370-20260918.yaml`,
  group A): `priv/repo/migrations/20260918173137_seed_default_tenant.exs` now
  permanently binds exactly one tenant to `idp_realm_id: "bpm-default"` in every
  migrated database (`tenants_idp_realm_id_partial_index` enforces at most one row per
  `idp_realm_id`, REQ-019). Several pre-existing test files need EXCLUSIVE, test-owned
  control of that binding for one test's duration — a fresh, empty schema they alone
  write to (`test/letflow/plugs/auth_pipeline_test.exs`'s AC1 tests,
  `test/letflow/plugs/api_pipeline_integration_test.exs`'s AC2/AC4/AC5 tests,
  `test/letflow/routers/req077_promotion_pipeline_test.exs`'s design §12.9 smoke test),
  or, for one case (`auth_pipeline_test.exs`'s AC4 "tenant resolution fails" test), no
  binding at all. `test/letflow/identity_test.exs`'s
  `resolve_tenant_by_realm/1`/`resolve_realm_by_tenant/1` tests only need a
  consistent READ of whichever tenant currently holds the binding.

  `displace!/0` deletes whatever tenant currently holds the `"bpm-default"` binding
  (normally the migration-seeded row) and registers an `on_exit/1` that re-inserts a
  row with the SAME `slug`/`display_name`/`idp_realm_id`, so every later test still
  finds the permanently-seeded tenant it expects.

  ## Self-healing repair (ISS-0766 — REQUIRED, do not remove)

  The migration-seeded `"bpm-default"` row is a singleton — `mix ecto.migrate` never
  re-inserts it once the seed migration is recorded as applied. This project's test
  databases (`letflow_test#{N}`) are long-lived and reused across many unrelated
  `mix test`/`scripts/test_parallel.sh` invocations, so if the OS process running a
  `displace!/0` caller is ever killed abnormally (SIGKILL, OOM-kill, CI
  timeout/cancellation) between its `Repo.delete!` and its `on_exit`-deferred
  restoration, the row is gone from that physical database PERMANENTLY — and every
  later `displace!/0`/`with_lock/1` call against that same database would otherwise
  observe `nil` forever, with no re-seeding path (confirmed via live reproduction:
  killing a `scripts/test_parallel.sh` run mid-flight left `letflow_test1` with zero
  rows bound to `"bpm-default"`, reproducing `test/letflow/identity_test.exs`'s
  REQ-019 AC1 failures deterministically on every subsequent run). Both `displace!/0`
  and `with_lock/1` therefore call `ensure_seeded!/1` first, under the advisory lock,
  which idempotently re-inserts the row
  (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT (slug) DO NOTHING`, the exact shape
  `priv/repo/migrations/20260918173137_seed_default_tenant.exs` uses) on the SAME
  dedicated connection that holds the lock — so a genuinely-fresh/never-seeded
  database and a previously-corrupted one are repaired identically, and no
  lost-update race between two repairing callers is possible (the advisory lock
  already serializes them).

  ## Mutual exclusion (REQUIRED — do not remove)

  **Two escalating bugs fixed while building this, both reproduced live, neither
  merely suspected:**

  1. First cut assumed `async: false` alone gave full mutual exclusion against every
     other test in the suite — it does not (only against other `async: false`
     modules, and even that boundary is not the whole story once other genuinely
     concurrent processes are touching the same database).
  2. Second cut used a plain BEAM-process `Agent` as a mutex — this correctly
     serializes every test PROCESS within one `mix test` VM, but this project
     routinely has **multiple separate `mix test`/`scripts/test_parallel.sh`
     invocations running as distinct OS processes against the same shared,
     non-partitioned default test database** (confirmed live via
     `SELECT application_name, count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity GROUP BY
     application_name`, which showed two distinct `letflow_mixtest_*` connections
     simultaneously while diagnosing this). An `Agent` is per-VM state — it cannot
     serialize across OS processes at all, so this still raced.

  The actual fix: a real Postgres session-scoped advisory lock
  (`pg_advisory_lock`/`pg_advisory_unlock`), held on a **dedicated `Postgrex`
  connection opened outside Ecto's own pool** (`Postgrex.start_link/1`, config
  copied from `Letflow.Repo.config/0`) — deliberately NOT `Repo.query!/2`, since
  Ecto's pool checks out a (potentially different) physical connection per call, and
  advisory locks are tied to the specific session/connection that acquired them: a
  release attempted from a different connection than the one that acquired the lock
  silently does nothing, leaking the lock for the life of that connection. Owning one
  dedicated connection end to end (acquire on it, release on that exact same one)
  sidesteps that hazard entirely, and — being a real Postgres lock, not BEAM state —
  correctly serializes across any number of concurrently-running `mix test` OS
  processes sharing the same database, which is the actual scope this problem needs
  covering at.

  Switches `Ecto.Adapters.SQL.Sandbox` to global `:auto` mode itself (idempotent to
  call again if the caller already has) — the migration-seeded row is real, committed
  Postgres state, invisible to/unreachable from a normal sandboxed transaction.
