  @moduledoc """
  Minimal local HTTP/1.1 OIDC discovery + JWKS server for REQ-370's AC2/AC3/AC5
  tests (`test/letflow/oidc/provider_registry_multi_realm_test.exs`).

  **Why this exists, not real Keycloak.** REQ-370's own design doc
  (`lib/letflow/design/req370-multi-issuer-oidc-verification.md` §11 "AC2") is
  explicit that the cross-realm-forgery check needs a token "whose `iss` claims
  realm A but whose signature was produced with realm B's own signing key...
  constructing this directly via the test double's/fixture's own key material --
  not obtainable from a real Keycloak, since that would require possessing another
  realm's private key". A real Keycloak instance never hands out its realms'
  private signing keys over any API, so AC2's negative case is only constructible
  against a fixture this suite fully controls the key material of. Having built
  that fixture, AC3 (>=2 realms independently verify) and AC5 (revocation) reuse it
  too, for determinism -- this environment's real Keycloak container (used by
  `test/letflow/integration/keycloak_auth_pipeline_test.exs`) was directly observed
  to `:httpc` `{:transport_error, :timeout}` intermittently against repeated calls
  during this same session, which would make a real-Keycloak-based AC2/AC3/AC5 test
  file flaky in a way unrelated to the property under test.

  **Why a raw `:gen_tcp` server, not `Bandit`/`Plug.Router`.** Mirrors
  `Letflow.WebhookTestServer`'s own established precedent and stated rationale in
  this exact `test/support/` directory: `Bypass`/`Plug.Cowboy` are not in
  `mix.lock`, and reaching for this repo's own production HTTP stack (`Bandit`,
  `Plug.Router`) for one test-only mock server was judged heavier than the ~100
  lines of raw HTTP/1.1 response-writing this needs (GET-only, no request body to
  parse -- simpler than `WebhookTestServer`'s own POST-with-body case). `:gen_tcp`/
  `:inets` are already part of the OTP standard library, so this adds no new
  dependency of any kind, matching `WebhookTestServer`'s own "zero new test
  mechanism" precedent.

  ## What it serves

  For each realm named in `start/1`'s `realms` list, a fresh 2048-bit RSA keypair
  is generated (`JOSE.JWK.generate_key/1`) and this server answers:

    * `GET /realms/<realm>/.well-known/openid-configuration` -- a minimal OIDC
      discovery document (only the fields `oidcc`'s own decoder requires:
      `issuer`, `authorization_endpoint`, `jwks_uri`, `scopes_supported`,
      `response_types_supported`, `subject_types_supported`,
      `id_token_signing_alg_values_supported` -- confirmed against
      `deps/oidcc/src/oidcc_provider_configuration.erl`'s own `extract/2` field
      list). `issuer` is set to exactly `<base_url>/realms/<realm>` -- `oidcc`
      rejects a discovery document whose own `"issuer"` field doesn't match the
      URI it was configured with (`oidcc_provider_configuration.erl`'s
      `issuer_mismatch` check), so this must match byte-for-byte what
      `Letflow.Oidc.ProviderRegistry.start_worker/2` constructs as
      `keycloak_base_url <> "/realms/" <> realm`.
    * `GET /realms/<realm>/protocol/openid-connect/certs` -- `{"keys": [<public
      JWK>]}`, that realm's own public key only (never another realm's) --
      this is what makes AC2's routing-isolation property observable: realm A's
      provider worker only ever learns realm A's own public key from this server,
      so a token signed with realm B's key cannot verify against it.
    * Anything else -- `404`.

  ## Lifecycle

  `start/1` binds an OS-assigned free `127.0.0.1` port (never a fixed one, so
  concurrent/`async: false`-serialized test runs never collide with each other or
  a real service -- same reasoning as `Letflow.WebhookTestServer.start_with_responder/1`),
  spawns a linked, unsupervised accept-loop process (test-only; never added to
  `Letflow.Application`'s supervision tree), and registers `ExUnit.Callbacks.on_exit/1`
  to kill the acceptor and close the listening socket, so no port or process leaks
  into the next test.

  Returns `%{base_url:, realms: %{realm => %{issuer:, jwk:, kid:}}}` -- `realms`
  carries each realm's own PRIVATE `JOSE.JWK.t()`, used by `sign_token/3` below to
  mint tokens (this map is test-only fixture state, never served over HTTP -- only
  each realm's derived PUBLIC JWK is ever written to the wire, via the
  `/certs` endpoint above).
