  @moduledoc """
  ISS-0883 regression test — unit-level coverage of `Letflow.Test.StatusHistory.entries/1`
  against a hermetic, synthetic fixture reproducing PR #1972's real failure shape.

  Specified by `lib/letflow/design/iss0883-status-index-indent-check.md` ("Worked
  example (concrete, using PR #1972's actual shape)").

  Why this file exists separately from `test/docs/requirement_status_invariants_test.exs`'s
  A9/A11 blocks: A9 and A11 only ever run against the real on-disk
  `docs/status/requirement_status.*.yaml` files, which are (and should stay) well-formed.
  Nothing in the suite before this file demonstrated that the ISS-0883 fix actually
  *catches* malformed input — only that well-formed input still parses correctly. This
  file writes a throwaway fixture, at PR #1972's exact 0-indent shape, directly at
  `entries/1`, so the fix's two claims are both exercised for real:

    1. A 0-indent `- req:` entry is still COUNTED (the false-green/miscounting half of
       the bug — pre-fix, `~r/^  - (...)/` requires an exact 2-space prefix and simply
       never matches a 0-indent line, so `entries/1` would return `[]` for this fixture:
       confirmed by reading the pre-fix regex in the ISS-0883 design doc's "Root cause"
       section, quoted again at the `pre_fix_item_regex/0` doctest-style comment below
       — no revert-and-rerun needed, the anchor makes the non-match provable by
       inspection).
    2. The entry's recorded `indent` is `0`, not `2`, and A11's own one-line predicate
       (`indent != 2`) — reused verbatim, not reimplemented — flags it as a violation.

  Nothing here touches `docs/status/` or any real volume/index file.
