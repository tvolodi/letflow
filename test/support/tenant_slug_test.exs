  @moduledoc """
  Regression test for ISS-0059 ("Flaky slug collision in migrations_test.exs's
  insert_tenant!/0 (:auto sandbox, real commits)") — proves both halves of the
  fix:

  1. The PRE-FIX mechanism (`"<prefix>-\#{System.unique_integer([:positive,
     :monotonic])}"`) really does collide across two independent BEAM VM
     runs — not a hypothetical, mechanically demonstrated below by spawning
     genuinely separate OS processes, each a fresh VM, and showing their
     first `unique_integer/1` call returns the identical value every time.
     This is precisely ISS-0059's failure mode: a prior `mix test` invocation
     crashes before its `on_exit` cleanup runs (leaving a `tenants` row with
     slug `"req027-1"` committed for real, since these modules run
     `Sandbox.mode(Letflow.Repo, :auto)`), and the next `mix test` VM's
     counter restarts from 1, generating the identical slug and colliding
     against the real `tenants_slug_index` unique constraint.

  2. The POST-FIX mechanism (`Letflow.TenantSlugFixture.unique_slug/1`, an
     `Ecto.UUID.generate/0`-derived suffix) does NOT exhibit this failure —
     shown two ways: (a) the exact same "spawn independent fresh VMs" method
     used to prove the old mechanism collides, applied to the new mechanism,
     produces distinct slugs every time, because `Ecto.UUID.generate/0`'s
     122 bits of randomness are not seeded from any counter or value that
     resets across VM restarts; and (b) a `StreamData` property test
     generating thousands of `unique_slug/1` calls within a single run and
     asserting zero collisions.

  ## Why this is proven by spawning real OS processes, not "simulated"

  `System.unique_integer/1`'s own documentation states its uniqueness
  guarantee is scoped to "the current runtime system instance" — i.e. one
  BEAM VM run, not across runs. There is no supported way to reset that
  counter within a single running VM to fake a "VM restart", and faking one
  with a hand-picked low integer would only be *asserting* the bug, not
  *proving* it. Spawning `elixir -e ...` as a separate OS process is not a
  simulation — each invocation genuinely is a fresh BEAM VM, mechanically
  identical (for this counter's purposes) to what happens when a killed
  `mix test` run is followed by a fresh one. This gives a literal
  fail-then-pass demonstration for this specific bug class, rather than the
  property-test-only fallback this class of VM-restart bug would otherwise
  require.

  See `lib/letflow/design/iss059-flaky-slug-collision-fix.md` for the full
  fix design and the 30-file edit-pattern table, and
  `test/support/tenant_slug.ex` for the fixed helper itself.
