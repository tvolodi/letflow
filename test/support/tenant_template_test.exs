  Permanent regression test for ISS-0427 — design
  `lib/letflow/design/iss0427-tenant-test-schema-template-clone.md` §3.4 use
  site 2: "a dedicated test file ... that clones a throwaway tenant and calls
  `assert_clone_parity!("tenant_template", <clone's own schema_name>)` across
  ALL thirteen dimensions #1-13. This is the test that stays green build
  after build and is what 'constraint parity must be ASSERTED, not assumed'
  ... cashes out to as an actual, permanent, always-run regression test."

  Before this file existed, `assert_clone_parity!/2` was reachable from
  exactly one runnable place (`ensure_template!/0`'s own build-time
  self-check, use site 1 — see `test/support/tenant_template.ex`'s
  `assert_template_parity_against_independent_reference!/0`), which proves
  the TEMPLATE is faithful to a migration-built reference but never proves
  that an actual `clone_tenant_schema!/1` output — the thing every real test
  in this suite consumes via `TenantFixture.provisioned_tenant!/1`'s default
  `template: :clone` — stays in parity with the template build after build,
  on every suite run. This file closes that gap: it is a real, always-run
  ExUnit test (no `@tag :skip`, no manual/one-off script), not a one-time
  manual verification.

  Uses `Letflow.DataCase` (real Postgres) per
  `docs/guides/test_developer_guide.md` DIRECTIVE T-1 — no mocked database.
  `async: false`, matching every other tenant-schema-provisioning test in
  this suite (`promotion_test.exs`, `tenant_fixture` itself) — schema-level
  DDL (`CREATE SCHEMA`, `DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE`) and the shared
  `"tenant_template"` schema this test builds against are not per-connection
  sandboxed state, so concurrent runs of this file's own tests, or of any
  other file that also calls `ensure_template!/0`/`clone_tenant_schema!/1`
  concurrently, would race on the SAME physical schema names — this is the
  same reasoning `Letflow.Test.TenantTemplate`'s own design §4.2 gives for
  why template-building calls are already serialized by
  `Sandbox.mode(Letflow.Repo, :auto)` defeating `async: true` suite-wide the
  moment any test using this fixture runs.

    # WHY rather than deleted or silently made to pass. Run against this
    # step's own wiring (2026-09-04), both actually FAILED with "Expected
    # exception ExUnit.AssertionError but nothing was raised" -- i.e.
    # assert_clone_parity!/2 returned :ok on a clone with a REAL,
    # confirmed-live cross-schema coupling. This is a MAJOR finding,
    # reported per this run's own instruction to stop and report rather than
    # adjust the check to pass, NOT fixed here (see this step's handoff for
    # the full writeup) -- fixing normalize/3 is out of this step's own
    # scope (TEST-DESIGNER does not modify parity-check logic; that is
    # ELIXIR-DEV's / a follow-up issue's job). Left present, not deleted,
    # because they are exactly the regression proof whoever fixes
    # normalize/3 needed -- the fix landed, the skips are gone, and both
    # pass.
    #
    # ROOT CAUSE (independently reproduced via throwaway `mix run` probes
    # this step, not merely asserted): `normalize/3`
    # (test/support/tenant_template.ex) strips BOTH `reference_schema.` and
    # `candidate_schema.` qualifiers from a definition string before
    # comparing reference vs candidate. This is correct for the ORDINARY
    # case (a genuinely clone-local object correctly qualified to its own
    # schema on each side) but is BLIND to the exact hazard dimensions
    # #2/#3/#5/#8 exist to catch: a candidate-side object that still
    # literally contains the REFERENCE schema's own qualifier (i.e. is
    # present but points at the template, not a clone-local copy) gets that
    # exact evidence silently erased by the same normalization step that
    # legitimately strips it from the correct case. A `pg_get_serial_sequence`
    # -based check (dimension #5's OTHER assertion, the "sequence namespace
    # leak" check in check_sequences/2) is unaffected -- it resolves the
    # sequence OWNED BY relationship structurally (pg_depend), not by text
    # comparison -- but that check only fires when the DEFAULT and the
    # sequence's OWNED BY diverge, which a plain `ALTER ... SET DEFAULT
    # nextval(...)` repoint (this test's own tamper, and the shape a real
    # clone-mechanism regression forgetting the repoint step would produce)
    # does NOT do: it changes only the DEFAULT text, not sequence ownership.
    # So the ONE dimension-#5 assertion built specifically to survive
    # qualifier-normalization blindness (see design §0's "sequence trap"
    # framing) is not reached by this tamper shape at all.
    # POST-FIX UPDATE (ORCH, after normalize/3 was corrected to strip only
    # each side's OWN schema qualifier): this tamper IS now caught, and is
    # caught EARLIER than dimension #5 -- dimension #2's column comparison
    # sees the surviving qualifier directly, reference reading
    # `nextval('events_global_seq_seq'::regclass)` against candidate
    # `nextval('tenant_template.events_global_seq_seq'::regclass)`. The
    # assertion below therefore matches [dim #2], not [dim #5]. Catching it
    # at #2 is strictly better than at #5 (the leak is visible in the raw
    # column default, no pg_depend resolution needed); the original [dim #5]

    # own §2.3, explicitly NOT fully closing) the window.
    #
    # THREE APPROACHES WERE TRIED AND REJECTED BEFORE THIS ONE, IN ORDER,
    # EACH FOR A CONCRETE, MEASURED REASON (kept here, not deleted, because
    # the reasoning is load-bearing for why this file's own regression test
    # takes the shape it does):
    #
    # 1. Direct unit test of clear_migrations_applied_flag!/1 itself. Rejected:
    #    it is a brand-new PRIVATE function (`defp`) of this module, not
    #    exported at the BEAM level -- calling it from this external test
    #    module raises UndefinedFunctionError. There is no existing seam this
    #    module exposes for reaching private helpers (checked: the only
    #    precedent, assert_template_parity_against_independent_reference!/1,
    #    is public specifically because ITS OWN design intended it to be
    #    tested directly -- clear_migrations_applied_flag!/1 was not given
    #    the same treatment, and this test must not modify the already-
    #    implemented fix to add one).
    # 2/3. Force a real rebuild (via the same fingerprint-corruption
    #    technique the "ISS-0842" describe block above already uses) and
    #    busy-poll `tenant_schemas` from a separate connection for the
    #    throwaway row's `migrations_applied_at`, asserting either "never
    #    observed" or "observed for at most N ms". Both rejected after
    #    actually measuring, not assumed:
    #    - post-fix, the window is NOT zero-width even in principle: the two
    #      `maybe_seed_platform_event_types/2`/`maybe_seed_entity_event_types/2`
    #      calls run INSIDE `replay_migrations/2`, AFTER `mark_migrations_applied/1`
    #      commits and BEFORE `replay_migrations/2` returns -- i.e. still
    #      inside the stamped window even post-fix, by design (§2.3's own
    #      "not eliminated"). Measured directly at ~40-50ms per rebuild. So
    #      "never observed" is not a valid post-fix expectation.
    #    - a duration-bound variant (amplifying the discriminator via a
    #      temporary `LETFLOW_TEMPLATE_REFCHECK=1`, which makes the pre-fix
    #      window include a second full 53-migration replay) DID discriminate
    #      cleanly in an isolated single-file run (fixed: ~91-93ms; a
    #      temporary local revert of both call sites: ~2.7-2.8s) -- but
    #      failed when actually run as part of the full
    #      `mix letflow.check.test` suite: under real connection-pool
    #      contention from concurrently-running tests, the FIXED code's own
    #      measured window ballooned to 9895-14916ms, blowing through any
    #      sane fixed bound. This is exactly the documented cost-placement
    #      hazard `template_self_check!/1`'s own comment already warns about
    #      for `LETFLOW_TEMPLATE_REFCHECK` under load, and it is also exactly
    #      what this project's own core directives forbid ("don't depend on
    #      wall-clock time") -- a timing-based assertion is fundamentally

    # clauses that make up the fix -- not the mere presence of a string, and
    # it demonstrably discriminates fixed from reverted code (see the FAIL
    # evidence in this run's own handoff report: reverting the two call
    # sites, exactly as ELIXIR-DEV's commit added them, makes this test fail
