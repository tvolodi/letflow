/**
 * REQ-336 AC7 — every string rendered by a component this requirement adds
 * is sourced from a react-intl message catalog covering kk, ru and en. This
 * test IS the grep the acceptance criterion names, run programmatically (not
 * shelled out, so it runs the same way under `npm test` on any host) against
 * every non-catalog file this requirement added or touched:
 *
 *   grep -nE ">[A-Za-z][A-Za-z '.-]{2,}<" \
 *     web/src/components/entities/EntityRecordForm.tsx \
 *     web/src/i18n/EntitiesIntlProvider.tsx
 *
 * (message-catalog files -- web/src/i18n/entitiesMessages.ts -- are
 * deliberately excluded: THEY are the source of the strings, not a hit.)
 *
 * ISS-0655: REQ-336's `TagListPage.tsx` pilot was removed as superseded dead
 * code once `tag` was wired into the generic `EntityCrudPage` path (it was
 * already generalized by REQ-343 for the other nine entity types; `tag` was
 * the one dropped from that generalization). Removed from the file list
 * below along with it.
 *
 * It also asserts entitiesMessages itself carries all three locales for
 * every id, so the catalog side of the AC is checked, not only the "no
 * inline literal" side.
