/** entities API client — REQ-336
 *
 *  Follows web/src/api/definitions.ts's own shape exactly: a plain object of
 *  named functions wrapping client.get/post/put/delete, typed against
 *  web/src/types/api.ts. Not a new client abstraction.
 *
 *  ⛔ THE REAL ROUTE TABLE (lib/letflow/routers/entities.ex), READ IN FULL
 *  BEFORE CHANGING THIS FILE. There is NO `GET /entities/records/:entity_type`
 *  list route and NO `GET /entities/records/:entity_type/:record_id` single-
 *  record route -- that router's own moduledoc states it explicitly ("No
 *  route reads a record by id, and none lists records"):
 *  `Letflow.Entities.Records` is command-only (create/update/delete), and the
 *  only read path for a record, single or many, is `POST /entities/query`
 *  (Letflow.Entities.Query.Compiler, cursor-paginated via
 *  Letflow.Entities.Query.Cursor). "Get one record to populate an edit form"
 *  is the SAME route as "list records", filtered to one `record_id` -- there
 *  is no cheaper way to fetch a single record today. Do NOT add a
 *  `getRecord`/`listRecords` function here: no such route exists, and a
 *  client that called one would fail at request time, not at build/lint
 *  time, which is exactly the trap this file exists to avoid.
 *
 *  Definition metadata (field list, types, required-ness, enum_values) comes
 *  from `GET /entities/definitions/active/:name` -- `getActiveDefinition`.
 *  Create is `POST /entities/records/:entity_type`, update
 *  `PUT /entities/records/:entity_type/:record_id`, delete
 *  `DELETE /entities/records/:entity_type/:record_id`.
 *
 *  update_record's route table row lists 409 as a real response
 *  (optimistic-concurrency conflict) -- the identical X-Resource-Version
 *  shape client.ts's request() already special-cases for PD-08. This module
 *  adds no new conflict-detection mechanism: `updateRecord`'s `ifMatch`
 *  parameter is threaded through as the `If-Match` header on the PUT call,
 *  and a 409 response propagates as the same `ApiError` (with
 *  `details.xResourceVersion`) client.ts's `request()` already builds --
 *  callers (the edit form) catch it and read `details.xResourceVersion`
 *  exactly as PD-08's existing ConflictResolver does elsewhere.
