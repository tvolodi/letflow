/**
 * ISS-0655 regression test.
 *
 * REQ-326 authored ten entity definitions under
 * priv/packs/bilimbaga/entity_definitions/, but
 * BILIMBAGA_ENTITY_TYPES (this config's admin-screen wiring list) once
 * carried only nine -- `tag` was silently dropped when REQ-343 generalized
 * REQ-336's `TagListPage.tsx` pilot into the entity-agnostic
 * `EntityCrudPage`, leaving `/admin/bilimbaga/tag` 404ing with no admin
 * screen despite `tag` being a real, write-accepting pack entity type.
 *
 * This test reads the real pack directory on disk (not a hard-coded
 * mirror of it) and asserts every ADMIN-MANAGEABLE entity type there has a
 * corresponding BILIMBAGA_ENTITY_TYPES entry, so the two lists cannot
 * silently diverge again. "Admin-manageable" excludes pack entity types that
 * have no admin-authoring path, for either of two distinct reasons: (a)
 * runtime-state types (session and its four session_* satellites), written
 * by the exam-session engine at runtime, not authored through an admin CRUD
 * screen -- there is deliberately no admin screen for any of them; and (b)
 * other pack entity types that are declarative, system-written records with
 * no admin-authoring path by their own requirement's explicit scope
 * decision rather than by architectural necessity -- currently just
 * `certificate` (REQ-355): per certificate.json's own description this is a
 * "declarative record shape with no execution semantics of its own," issued
 * by `Letflow.Exam.Certificate`'s idempotent issue-on-first-request logic
 * triggered by a candidate's own action (not the session engine), and
 * lib/letflow/exam/certificate.ex's moduledoc states plainly that an admin
 * bypass/route "is future work for whichever requirement" picks it up --
 * i.e. deferred, not ruled out. Neither type family is expected to appear
 * in BILIMBAGA_ENTITY_TYPES.
