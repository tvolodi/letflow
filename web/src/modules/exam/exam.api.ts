/** exam session API client — REQ-338
 *
 *  Follows web/src/api/definitions.ts's own shape: a plain object of named
 *  functions wrapping client.get/post/put, typed against exam.types.ts.
 *  Wraps REQ-335's ACTUAL route table
 *  (lib/letflow/routers/exam_sessions.ex's own moduledoc "Route table"),
 *  re-verified directly against that router's source, not the speculative
 *  paths this requirement's own description guessed at before REQ-335 landed.
 *  REQ-410 moved the router to /api/v1/modules/exam/exam-sessions:
 *
 *    | Handler             | Method/path                                               |
 *    |---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
 *    | start_session        | POST   /modules/exam/exam-sessions                       |
 *    | get_session_state    | GET    /modules/exam/exam-sessions/:id                    |
 *    | autosave_answer      | PUT    /modules/exam/exam-sessions/:id/answers/:q_id      |
 *    | submit_session       | POST   /modules/exam/exam-sessions/:id/submit             |
 *    | report_event         | POST   /modules/exam/exam-sessions/:id/events             |
 *
 *  Mounted at `/modules/exam/exam-sessions` under the authenticated `/api/v1`
 *  forward (REQ-410's naming), so every path below is
 *  `/api/v1/modules/exam/exam-sessions...`.
 *
 *  Five named operations, matching this requirement's own description
 *  exactly (startSession, saveAnswer, submitSession, getSessionState,
 *  reportEvent) — REQ-335's real shapes did NOT differ from that description
 *  once its real routes were read (only the description's OWN speculative
 *  path guesses were wrong; the operation list held).
 *
 *  ISS-0718: `listAvailableExams` below replaces this requirement's original
 *  `queryExamRecords` call onto the generic `POST /entities/query` route.
 *  CANDIDATE cannot reach that route — `:EntitiesQuery` is outside
 *  CANDIDATE's ISS-0646 closed permission set, so every CANDIDATE call was a
 *  guaranteed 403. `listAvailableExams` instead calls the new, dedicated
 *  `GET /modules/exam/exam-sessions/available` route (added by ISS-0718's fix, gated on
 *  CANDIDATE's existing `:ExamSessionStart` permission — no new grant), which
 *  hardcodes `entity_type: "exam"` and `status: active` server-side rather
 *  than accepting caller-supplied filters. See
 *  `lib/letflow/design/iss0718-candidate-exam-list-route.md` for the full
 *  design. `ExamRecord`/`ExamRecordsPage` below are unchanged — the new
 *  route returns the identical response shape the old one did.
