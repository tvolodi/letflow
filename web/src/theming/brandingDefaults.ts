 * iterated by ITS OWN keys, never the tenant-supplied object's keys.
 *
 * No colour literal appears in this file: the allowlist maps a brand_colors sub-key
 * name to a CSS custom-property NAME, never to a colour value. The colour value
 * itself always comes from tokens.css's own cascade (default) or the tenant's
 * response body (override) — never hard-coded here.
