/**
 * Pipeline: BilimBaga candidate timed exam autograde
 *
 * Drives `test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/bilimbaga/candidate-timed-exam-autograde.yaml`'s
 * `pipeline_test:` key for UAT-RUNNER. Ported from a real, hand-driven browser
 * walkthrough against live QA (`https://qa.bizdala.com`) run on 2026-09-20 —
 * see `test/uat-reports/gui-review-2026-09-19-bilimbaga-candidate-exam-rerun.md`'s
 * "2026-09-20 re-run" section for the full screen-by-screen review this spec
 * formalizes.
 *
 * Chain topology (three steps, matching the scenario's own three actor steps):
 *   login (candidate-user, bilimbaga realm)
 *   → open exam list, start the exam (step 1+2)          [produces: examTitle]
 *   → answer every question, submit (step 3)              [produces: scoreText]
 *
 * THREE KNOWN, ALREADY-FILED GUI GAPS THIS SPEC DELIBERATELY WORKS AROUND
 * (not re-litigated here; each has its own open issue and is out of this
 * pilot's scope to fix):
 *
 *   - ISS-0727: the plain `https://qa.bizdala.com` base URL resolves
 *     `GET /api/tenant-config?host=...` to the WRONG realm (`bpm-default`)
 *     for this tenant on this QA host. This spec logs in via
 *     `pipeline.ts`'s realm-taking `getKeycloakToken(..., 'bilimbaga')`
 *     overload (a real Keycloak password-grant token minted directly
 *     against the correct realm) and `loginWithToken` (sessionStorage
 *     injection), which never depends on `/api/tenant-config`'s host-based
 *     realm resolution at all — so this workaround is structural, not a
 *     query-string hack layered on the broken path.
 *   - ISS-0729: CANDIDATE has no nav-sidebar link to `/exam` anywhere in the
 *     real GUI (`AppShell.tsx`'s `Role` type does not even include
 *     `'CANDIDATE'`). This spec reaches `/exam` via `pipeline.ts`'s
 *     `navigateSpa` helper instead of clicking a nav link that does not
 *     exist.
 *   - ISS-0726: a HARD navigation (full page load / `page.goto` while
 *     relying on a live OIDC session) to `/exam` bounces back to `/` instead
 *     of rendering `ExamListPage` — but that bug is specifically about the
 *     OIDC-redirect-callback round trip losing the originally-requested
 *     path. `loginWithToken`'s sessionStorage-injected session sidesteps
 *     that entirely (no OIDC redirect ever fires on this navigation), so
 *     `navigateSpa`'s own `page.goto(targetPath)` reaches `ExamListPage`
 *     reliably even though ISS-0726 is still open — proven live against QA
 *     while writing this spec (see the report referenced above).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXAM'S TWO QUESTIONS ARE HARDCODED BY STEM/ANSWER TEXT. The real
 * QA `bilimbaga` tenant currently seeds exactly one active exam ("Safety
 * Certification Exam", REQ-359/ISS-0690's own closeout) with two fixed MCQ
 * questions. `field_values.is_correct` on `answer_option` is deliberately
 * redacted from EVERY caller (`Letflow.Routers.ExamSessions`'s own
 * moduledoc "is_correct/answer-key redaction" section) — confirmed
 * redacted even for a `PLATFORM_ADMIN`-scoped `POST /entities/query` while
 * writing this spec, so there is no API-level way to discover the correct
 * answer generically. The two answers below (`Red` /
 * `Evacuate via the nearest exit`) were confirmed correct by a real,
 * observed 100% / "Сдано" (passed) grading result against live QA
 * immediately before this spec was written -- not guessed. Question ORDER
 * is not assumed fixed (a `materialize_session` seed draw was observed to
 * vary question order across two real sessions in this same tenant despite
 * `shuffle_questions: false`), so this spec answers by walking forward with
 * "Next" and matching each visible question's option text against a
 * preferred-answer table, the same order-agnostic technique
 * `exam-taking.e2e.spec.ts`'s `goToQuestionByStem` uses for its own
 * multi-question fixture.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT. This spec targets whatever `E2E_BASE_URL`/`BPM_TEST_URL`
 * point at (QA by default for this scenario's own `env: qa`), with
 * `UAT_QA_CANDIDATE_PASSWORD` supplying the real candidate-user credential
 * (falls back to a local-dev literal via `resolveCredential`, matching
 * every other pipeline spec's convention) — see
 * `ai-dala-infra/scripts/qa-login.sh candidate-user` for how to fetch it.
 *
 * CLEANUP / RE-RUN SAFETY. `Letflow.Exam.Session.check_no_open_session/1`
 * rejects a second `POST /exam-sessions` while one for this
 * (candidate, exam) pair is still `in_progress`, and `max_attempts` is
 * finite. `CANDIDATE` holds no `EntitiesQuery` permission (ISS-0718's own
 * design note), so there is no candidate-safe way to list-and-clean up a
 * stray open session left by a crashed prior run — the same structural gap
 * `exam-taking.e2e.spec.ts` sidesteps by using `admin-user` (which owns the
 * sessions it cleans up) throughout, not applicable here since CANDIDATE
 * itself is under test. This spec's own `afterAll` submits the session it
 * started (via the exact same candidate-owned token, so ownership always
 * matches) whenever the chain reaches step 2 — the normal-completion path
 * already submits via the UI itself, so this is only a safety net for an
 * aborted run. A truly external stray session (e.g. this spec killed
 * mid-run by the process being torn down, before `afterAll` can run) would
 * need a fresh `max_attempts` bump the same app-level way this pilot
 * unblocked its own first live run — see the UAT report referenced above.
