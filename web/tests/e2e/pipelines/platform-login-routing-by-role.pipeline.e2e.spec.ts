/**
 * Pipeline: Platform login routing by role
 *
 * Drives `test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/platform/platform-login-routing-by-role.yaml`'s
 * `pipeline_test:` key (ISS-0702) for UAT-RUNNER.
 *
 * Covers the scenario's three mutually-exclusive branches, each with its own
 * single EO-001. These are independent alternatives of the same login flow —
 * not a sequential chain — so each is modelled as its own self-contained
 * `test()` case rather than forced through `createPipeline()`'s
 * forward-state-accumulation shape (see
 * lib/letflow/design/iss-0702-uat-runner-pipeline-test-gap-fix.md §1.3):
 *
 *   1. PLATFORM_ADMIN lands on workspace root with admin nav (§1.4)
 *   2. Tenant-scoped role (TASK_WORKER) lands on workspace root, narrower nav (§1.5)
 *   3. Unauthenticated visitor sees auth-loading, then redirects off-origin (§1.6)
 *
 * Uses `helpers.ts`'s two-arg `getKeycloakToken`/`loginWithToken` (always
 * `bpm-default` realm) — NOT `pipeline.ts`'s three-arg realm-taking overload,
 * per the design's §1.1: every credential this spec needs (`admin-user`,
 * `worker-user`) lives in `bpm-default`.
 *
 * Each branch's `gui_screen` EO-001 is checked via hard, deterministic
 * `expect()` assertions rather than REQ-362's two-phase pixel-baseline
 * mechanism — see design §1.7 for the reasoned decision. The
 * `page.screenshot()` call in each branch is supplementary evidence attached
 * to a PASS/FAIL already decided by assertion, same convention as
 * `req133-ac2-ac5.e2e.spec.ts` and `uat-alice-login.e2e.spec.ts`.

    // run against a local stack) that `tenant-unknown-banner` is NOT a
    // usable proxy here: tenant resolution in this environment is by HTTP
    // Host header (`/api/tenant-config?host=...`, see TenantDashboardPage's

    // without a second tenant: the count tiles actually render live data (not
    // stuck on their loading skeleton, not replaced by the QueryStateBoundary
    // error state), confirming the scoped list queries
    // (queryKeys.instances.list/tasks.list, both filtered by the
    // authenticated tenant context) genuinely executed and resolved for this

    // isolation if the second tenant weren't provisioned. This is a
