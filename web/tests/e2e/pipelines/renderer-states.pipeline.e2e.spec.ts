/**
 * Pipeline: renderer-permission-denied-surface (ISS-0899, split from ISS-0890)
 *
 * Drives `test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/platform/renderer-permission-denied-surface.yaml`'s
 * `pipeline_test:` key for UAT-RUNNER. That scenario was BLOCKED only because this
 * file did not exist — the real security gap it depends on, REQ-378 ("Tenant-admin
 * role/status revocation has no live effect on an OIDC-authenticated session"), is
 * `status: done` and merged (`lib/letflow/design/req378-oidc-live-revocation-check.md`),
 * and the `PermissionDenied.tsx` renderer contract was already confirmed correct
 * pre-fix (REQ-378's own description). This spec is pure spec-authoring against
 * already-shipped behaviour — no new frontend/backend code.
 *
 * Mechanism under test (REQ-378 design §1-§3): `Letflow.Plugs.AuthPipeline`'s OIDC
 * branch now derives `conn.assigns.auth_context.roles` from a live, uncached
 * `group_members ⋈ tenant_role` query on every request (`Identity.list_effective_role_names/2`),
 * not from the bearer JWT's claims. Removing a user from a role-bearing group via
 * Letflow's own `web/` admin GUI therefore denies that user's very next API request —
 * no sign-out, no reload, no waiting for the access token to expire (REQ-378 AC1) —
 * and the resulting 403 renders through the existing, unmodified
 * `QueryStateBoundary`/`PermissionDenied` contract (REQ-378 AC3), which leaks nothing
 * about the underlying resource (a 5-line component with no resource props threaded
 * in — `web/src/components/ui/PermissionDenied.tsx`).
 *
 * "Area" mapping. R-Co's scenario is written against SwiftRoute's tenant-specific
 * "shipment administration" screen, which has no Letflow equivalent. The closest real
 * analogue in Letflow's own seeded platform tenant (`bpm-default`) is the DLQ admin
 * screen (`/dlq`, `web/src/pages/dlq/DlqPage.tsx`): an operator-only administration
 * area, reachable via the app's own sidebar nav (`AppShell.tsx`'s `NAV_ITEMS`), whose
 * `GET /api/v1/dlq` route is gated server-side by the `:DlqOperate` permission
 * (`lib/letflow/api/authorization.ex:608-609,992`) — held only by `PROCESS_OPERATOR`/
 * `PLATFORM_ADMIN` (`core_role_allows?/2`), never `TASK_WORKER`/`PROCESS_DESIGNER`/
 * `AGENT_RUNNER`/`CANDIDATE`. This is the scenario's "operations manager" role exactly.
 *
 * Actors — real, pre-seeded Keycloak users in the `bpm-default` realm
 * (`priv/keycloak/realms/bpm-default.json`), not fixtures created by this spec:
 *   - business_user = `operator-user` / `operator-pass`, realm role `PROCESS_OPERATOR`
 *   - tenant_admin   = `admin-user` / `admin-pass`, realm role `PLATFORM_ADMIN`
 * `operator-user` is bound to the seeded `PROCESS_OPERATOR` group
 * (`Letflow.Identity.RoleRegistry.seed_default_platform_role_groups/1`, ISS-0778) via
 * REQ-378's own one-time claims-to-`group_members` sync, which already ran the first
 * time this fixture user made any authenticated request in this environment — verified
 * directly against the real running stack while writing this spec: `GET /dlq` as
 * operator-user -> 200, `DELETE /groups/:id/members/:user_id` as admin-user -> 204,
 * immediate retry of the *same* operator-user token with no sleep -> 403, re-`POST`
 * the membership -> 201, retry -> 200 again. This spec drives the identical sequence
 * through the real `web/` GUI instead of raw HTTP.
 *
 * Two independent Playwright `BrowserContext`s, not one shared `page` with an
 * identity swap: the scenario's own step 3 requires business_user's session to never
 * sign out or reload while tenant_admin acts in the background — a single shared page
 * cannot model concurrent, independent sessions without destroying the very session
 * continuity the scenario is testing.
 *
 * Client-side nav staleness is explicitly NOT tested and NOT expected to change:
 * REQ-378 design §6 scopes `AppShell.tsx`'s client-side `session.roles` nav filter
 * ("gap 3") OUT of scope — the sidebar's "DLQ" link stays visible to operator-user
 * after revocation (nothing invalidates the in-memory session), and this spec
 * deliberately clicks that still-visible link anyway: the point of REQ-378 is that
 * the *server* denies the request regardless of what stale UI the client still shows.
 *
 * EO-004 (loading-placeholder-then-content, no layout jump) is checked with a hard,
 * deterministic assertion on `SkeletonLayout`'s `aria-busy="true"` placeholder
 * transitioning to `DataTable`'s `data-testid="data-table"` — not REQ-362's two-phase
 * pixel-baseline mechanism, same reasoned choice as
 * `platform-login-routing-by-role.pipeline.e2e.spec.ts` (its own file header, §1.7).
 *
 * INTERACTION NOTE (revised, ISS-0899 REVIEWER finding): every click below uses a
 * real, UA-trusted gesture — `locator.hover()` + `page.mouse.down()` +
 * `page.mouse.up()`, raced against a bounded timeout — exactly the pattern this
 * codebase already established and trusts in `iss-0662-entity-crud-click-freeze.e2e.spec.ts`,
 * `iss-0737-definition-name-click-freeze.e2e.spec.ts` and
 * `iss-0739-instance-start-dialog-click-freeze.e2e.spec.ts`. This file originally used
 * `Locator.dispatchEvent('click')`, justified at the time as a workaround for a claimed
 * sandbox-wide hang on real click/fill actionability. REVIEWER found that justification
 * wrong on both counts: (1) `dispatchEvent('click')` is precisely the mechanism those
 * three prior regression specs deliberately avoid, because it is the one thing proven
 * NOT to reproduce this exact freeze class (see their own header comments); relying on
 * it here would have silently exempted this spec from ever catching this bug again, and
 * (2) REVIEWER independently exercised this sandbox's Chromium against a minimal static
 * page and got a normal ~300ms `.click()`/`.fill()` resolution, refuting the "sandbox
 * hangs on all real clicks" claim outright.
 *
 * GroupsPage.tsx was checked directly against the real mechanism, not assumed either
 * way: a throwaway diagnostic spec drove `page.mouse.down()`/`mouse.up()` (hover first,
 * bounded at 5s, identical to `trustedClickBounded` in the three specs above) against
 * "Manage members" on a real running dev stack (`mix run` on :4000, Keycloak/Postgres via
 * `docker compose`). The very first trusted click — "Manage members" — froze the
 * renderer past the 5s bound: real, reproduced, not a Playwright-dispatch artifact. This
 * is the identical bug class as ISS-0662/0737/0739 — `GroupsPage.tsx`'s "Manage
 * members"/"Add member"/"Remove"/"Delete"/"+ New Group" buttons all called `setState`
 * (or a mutation whose `onSuccess` calls `setState`) synchronously inside their `onClick`
 * handler, the exact trigger shape those three fixes target. Fixed the same way as
 * `DataTable.tsx`/`EntityCrudPage.tsx`/`DefinitionListPage.tsx`/`InstanceBoardPage.tsx`:
 * every affected handler in `web/src/pages/admin/GroupsPage.tsx` now runs through
 * `deferClickState` (`web/src/utils/deferClickState.ts`), deferring the state update by
 * one macrotask so it never lands inside the native click's own dispatch turn. Re-ran the
 * same diagnostic trusted-click sequence (Manage members -> Add member -> Remove ->
 * Close) against the fixed tree: all four resolved normally, well under the 5s bound.
 * This fix (and the GroupsPage-specific finding) is bundled into this same PR rather than
 * filed separately — it is the direct, narrowly-scoped root cause of why this spec could
 * not safely use a real click in the first place, not an unrelated drift item.
