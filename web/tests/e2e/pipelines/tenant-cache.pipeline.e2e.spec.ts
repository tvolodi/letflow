/**
 * Pipeline: tenant-switch-cache-isolation (PW-15 / sys-tenant-scoped-client-cache)
 *
 * Drives `test/fixtures/uat/scenarios/platform/tenant-switch-cache-isolation.yaml`'s
 * `pipeline_test:` key for UAT-RUNNER, following this GUI-review sweep's own process:
 * every real screen was read from source before any test was written (see
 * test/uat-reports/gui-review-2026-09-20-tenant-switch-cache-isolation.md for the
 * full trace this spec's scope decisions come from).
 *
 * What the source investigation found, and why this spec covers what it covers:
 *
 *   - EO-001 (mid-session company switch via a selector, without reload) had NO
 *     underlying feature when this file was first authored (2026-09-20) — see
 *     the historical note this replaces, preserved in git history at commit
 *     `2b7f4a28`'s parent. REQ-384 has since shipped (`TenantSwitcher.tsx`,
 *     `AuthProvider.switchTenant`, tenant-keyed React Query cache) and this
 *     file now drives it for real below: provisions a second, genuinely
 *     separate tenant (its own real Postgres schema, migrated synchronously)
 *     via the real onboarding saga, grants the acting admin a
 *     `tenant_memberships` row into it (no HTTP write path ships with REQ-384
 *     for that table — design SS1.1, OQ-2 — so this is done via direct SQL,
 *     the same real-DDL-direct technique `db-exec.ts`'s own moduledoc already
 *     established for a different fixture need), seeds a tenant-B-owned
 *     marker process definition directly in that schema (no Keycloak
 *     realm/admin-user is provisioned for a self-service-onboarded tenant —
 *     confirmed by reading `Letflow.Routers.Onboarding`'s own moduledoc — so
 *     no HTTP credential scoped to tenant B exists either; same direct-write
 *     technique, see `createActiveDefinitionInSchema` in db-exec.ts), then
 *     clicks the real `TenantSwitcher` control and asserts the four-way
 *     isolation guarantee AC1-AC3 describe. Proof-of-isolation surface is
 *     `/definitions` (design §7.1 names `definitions` explicitly), NOT
 *     `/admin/users` — that screen was tried first and found to depend on a
 *     real, separate, pre-existing production bug (`web/src/api/identity.ts`'s
 *     `GET /api/v1/users` misses the `/identity` prefix the backend actually
 *     mounts under; filed ISS-0782/GH-1722) unrelated to REQ-384 and out of
 *     this spec's scope to fix.
 *
 *     LIVE RUN FINDING (TEST-DESIGNER, 2026-09-22, against a real running
 *     backend+Vite+Keycloak+Postgres stack): EO-001 currently FAILS, and not
 *     on a setup bug — a genuine REQ-384 implementation defect.
 *     `AuthProvider.switchTenant`'s `attemptSilentSwitch` (`tenantOidcRegistry.ts`)
 *     calls oidc-client-ts's `UserManager.signinSilent()`, which opens a
 *     hidden iframe at the SAME `redirect_uri` as the top-level login flow
 *     (`OidcManager.ts` sets no distinct `silent_redirect_uri`) and expects
 *     whatever loads in that iframe to call `manager.signinSilentCallback()`
 *     to post the result back to the pending promise. `OidcCallbackPage.tsx`
 *     — the one and only component mounted at that route — unconditionally
 *     calls `manager.signinRedirectCallback()` instead, with no branch for
 *     being loaded inside that hidden iframe. Confirmed live: the network
 *     trace shows Keycloak's `/protocol/openid-connect/auth?...&prompt=none`
 *     genuinely completing (302 to `/auth/callback?error=login_required` —
 *     expected here, since `loginWithToken`'s token-injection technique never
 *     established a real Keycloak SSO cookie for this browser to authenticate
 *     that iframe against), but neither `tenant-switcher-interaction-required`
 *     nor `tenant-switcher-error` (TenantSwitcher.tsx's own third, error-path
 *     testid) nor a completed switch ever appears — `switchTenant()`'s
 *     returned promise never settles within this spec's 30s budget, because
 *     nothing ever calls back into it. This is not specific to this sandbox's
 *     inability to establish a real SSO cookie: since NOTHING loaded in that
 *     iframe ever calls `signinSilentCallback()`, `signinSilent()` cannot
 *     resolve in ANY environment, including one where the target realm truly
 *     does have an active federated SSO session (the "silent_ok" branch could
 *     never fire either) — this is a mechanical wiring gap, independent of
 *     and strictly worse than the open OQ-3 question below (SS10 asks
 *     whether realms are federated enough for a silent switch to succeed;
 *     this defect means it structurally cannot succeed OR cleanly fall back,
 *     regardless of federation). Not fixed here (TEST-DESIGNER does not
 *     implement fixes) — reported for ORCH to route to FRONTEND-DEV. This
 *     spec is left asserting the real, intended behavior (a red test against
 *     the real defect), not loosened to pass around it.
 *
 *     Both prior claims in this comment block's earlier revisions —
 *     "TEST-DESIGNER could not run this test live" and "tenant B gets its
 *     own Keycloak realm" — were themselves inaccurate and are corrected
 *     above: this spec DID run live once the environment's actual Keycloak
 *     port (8092, not the 8082 default baked into some helpers'
 *     documentation) and dev-DB-write confirmation gate were accounted for,
 *     and REQ-384's self-service onboarding path (`Letflow.Routers.Onboarding`)
 *     deliberately does not provision Keycloak at all (its own moduledoc,
 *     "What is deliberately NOT ported") — tenant B is a real, separate
 *     Postgres schema with no realm of its own.
 *
 *   - EO-002 (signing out leaves nothing behind) IS the real, supported flow —
 *     and a genuine defect was found and fixed in this same change:
 *     `web/src/auth/tenantConfig.ts`'s `bpm_realm_slug` sessionStorage key
 *     (deliberate, OIDC-F-06) was never cleared by `AuthProvider.logout()`,
 *     letting one tenant's realm selection survive into the next sign-in on the
 *     same browser tab. Fixed via `resetTenantConfigCache()`, filed as ISS-0737.
 *     This spec proves the fix holds through a REAL sign-out click, not just the
 *     unit-level coverage in tenantConfig.test.ts / AuthProvider.logout-clears-realm.test.tsx.
 *
 *   - EO-003 (a task shows the form it was created against, not a later published
 *     version) is already satisfied by construction — REQ-126 (status: done) pins
 *     `form_id`/`form_version` from `instance_definition_snapshots.definition_ver`,
 *     frozen at instance-start time, and `TaskActivation.resolve_form_schema/1`
 *     freezes `form_schema` itself onto the `tasks` row at activation time. What
 *     had NOT been verified anywhere was that the real SPA screen (not just the
 *     JSON body, which test/letflow/routers/tasks_test.exs's REQ-126 AC3 test
 *     already covers) renders the pinned fields rather than the newly-promoted
 *     ones. This spec proves that end to end: create v1, start an instance, open
 *     the real Task Inbox screen, promote v2 with different form fields, reopen
 *     the same task and prove the screen still shows v1's fields only.
 *
 *   - EO-004 (explicit "out of date" fallback when a version can't be confirmed)
 *     has no implementation anywhere — filed as REQ-385, since REQ-126's
 *     frozen-at-creation design has no live version-resolution step that could
 *     even fail to confirm a match. Not attempted here; see REQ-385.
 *
 *   - EO-005 (frequently-changing lists refetch on return) already has working,
 *     independently-verified coverage via `usePolling` (interval + visibility-
 *     change refetch, read from source) — out of scope for this spec's own
 *     regression focus (MINOR severity, `suggested_action: none` in the scenario
 *     itself).
